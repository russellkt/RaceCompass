[Music] maggie and i really believe in the power of prep for racing and we have a really big list of things we like to do before a day of racing and the a little bit smaller of a list of things to do between races but um having a routine really helps you stay on task and helps it helps with nerves it helps make sure you don't miss anything especially on you know as the conditions change or the day goes on and you're starting to kind of mentally wear down a bit so we really believe in the power of prep and we hope that with this presentation we'll help you guys believe in it too it's funny because i think this is like steph's favorite part of the day like if we could launch three hours before start time and just go through the pre-start routine over and over and over again i think she would so we have about 75 percent of people say yes they have a pre-start routine that's awesome and uh you know i hope that we can teach you guys something about what we do or you can share with us something that you do that's a little bit different um yeah i think you know having your own routine um some people like to print them out put them in their life jacket i know for a while we did that and it just kind of helps you check things off the list and it depends on what kind of sailor you are if you're more laid back like want to just feel things out then a routine probably isn't for you but for us we really believe in this power of crap there's a lot of things to do in order to feel ready this is kind of our list of things that we like to do from when we leave the beach to basically when the first warning signal goes up or the orange fly goes up at 10 minutes we'll immediately get out to the race course and get into some upwind tuning we'll get the rig and sails dialed in for the different conditions with julia and then she'll kind of split off and go check the current while we focus on um doing some more tuning some some bow speed stuff um if it's a steady day we'll um split with our with our tuning partner if it's a shifty puffy day we'll focus on transitions and um and some boat handling as well um we'll get we'll get our compass numbers on each board we'll maybe sometimes write them down um upwind and downwind priests are bone handling you can check the bias of the gate if that's set um and you can do a lot of practice accelerations um one of my favorite things to do is to do accelerations between the gate marks if they're already set so you can really practice using a line and then you can check the bias at the same time killing two verses one stone so accelerations are we really really practice those a lot like we try to get five or so accelerations before every race um because they're such a critical part of of the race we get a lot of head to wins we check the angle off the line sometimes we'll just come around the committee boat end we'll come up on starboard close haul check the angle look under the boom okay this looks like in a lifted angle this confirms boat bias and you can kind of just circle around keep doing laps of the race coming boat you can also just spend time getting a feel for the line like we said earlier sail down the line on starboard and just get a feel for what it feels like to be there because it is it's an invisible line it feels weird um and then you can practice using your line site uh you know if you can get the line set early enough get your line sight and then practice kind of creeping in using that line site um counting down the time um another big one make sure the kite has no water in it and it was a clean takedown and check for weeds so that's what we like that's just a short list of things that we like to do there's a couple things to do yeah um but i would actually like to emphasize that like a few things are absolutely non-negotiable right like a few things we if if the starting gun goes off and we haven't done a couple accelerations we'll do them um because how many times of practice do you practice or how many times practice your practice accelerations and how many times has your first acceleration been your best of the day like i'll answer that question zero for me like my first acceleration is never ever the best it's never usually even good you know i need to think about how much weight am i helping like rock and pump the boat how much she like where is the gypsy going to um how much weight are we applying out you know all of these things like you don't want to figure all those things out first race of the day you know you want to just do a few runs and so that's like an absolute essential one if we're running on time we'll do a few of those after we get to time and then it's like okay a couple practices um i also wanted to know like yeah this seems like a pretty um tedious like checklist of things but when you do three or four or five races over the course of the day like mental fatigue is the real thing um and it's it's usually the last race of the day when everyone's like hungry and tired and that's when you miss that the there's been a 10 degree left shift or something and had had we done those compass line you know compass checks like we would have picked up on that um and so yeah these things really help us uh stay sharp and like help us catch the little things that nine times out of ten you would but then it's that same time you're tired and maybe you wouldn't like we talked about earlier we like to have this routine of things that we like to do from the moment we leave the beach until the orange flags go up where the five-minute flags go up however your sequence works and this is kind of our routine of um a way that we like to approach racing so five minutes we like to be at the race committee boat where it's really easy to get the time because you're right next to the person doing the countdown um you can check the course and the compass heading then you can bear away or sorry then you can go ahead to win kind of back up check your transit go forward and back and forward and back sometimes that's a little bit traffic dependent um and then we like to make our final rate call because we have to have that dialed in before four minutes and then at four minutes we check which prep flag went up we check the angle of the line so we'll kind of just hang out near the starboard end we'll bear away um send it down the line towards the middle we'll check the angle of the line there and then we'll go head to wind again from there um around three minutes we'll just spend time hanging out above the line looking up when discussing the game plan reminder of the priorities um those things that we discussed last week and then at two minutes we'll do our final game plan call and we'll split to a side so i we like being in the middle because if you say okay we really like the right you can split off to the boat end pretty easily if you like the left you can split off to the pin end pretty easily and that timing of that game plan might happen a little bit sooner let's say it's light air we'd probably err on the side of being in our spot around three minutes or four minutes so we need to know the game plan sooner but if it's a really puffy shifty day we're not gonna make that final game plan call until two minutes um and then one minute we kind of started making our final approach to the line um we start dialing into the boats around us um our distance to the line and then and our setup on the boats around us um and we kind of have this time as like a a final bailout time um so one minute comes around and we're not liking the spot that we're in for whatever reason um we'll say okay it's time to start looking for a bailout because that's the amount of time we believe it takes to do a circle and get back to finding a good hole on the line um at 30 seconds our attention kind of goes to where is our bow um in relation to other boats are we are we bow out on boats are we bow behind on boats um and how is our gap to lure do we have a good gap to lure it or um are we going to be struggling with that gap um and then 20 seconds focusing on the pressure for the start um so maggie's kind of looking towards both sides of the line and i'm kind of looking forward so i make a call and what pressure we're going to have and then that affects our acceleration if it's a really steady day probably don't need to make a call but if it's a really puffy shifty day then we'll make a call like pressure's up for this acceleration or you know we're going to have a really light acceleration here um and then maggie goes controls on around 20 seconds um and then we really start managing the flow based on our time and distance and when where our bow is to other boats so if we're really early we're starting to have a little bit less we want a little bit less flow forward if we're if we're late we're starting to really pick up the pace and pick up the flow in the boat um and then that's also kind of our earmarked time for a final double tack so something that's fun about our our fleet is we do a lot of double tacking to position ourselves um really strong on the boats around us so um 20 seconds is kind of like the final time that you can really make that that double tack up to the windward boat um and that all somehow happens in five seconds according to my list um but at 15 seconds we start talking about our acceleration time and that's maggie really leads the charge on that based on the distance that she's seeing um but i'll also chime in based on the amount of flow that we have if we don't have a lot of flow but we have um a lot of time to the line like then we really need that acceleration time needs to happen sooner um and then we from there we just we get into our preload phase which is just kind of tensioning putting tension on the leeches of the sails and just starting to get the sails drawing some more and then we execute the acceleration so kind of just breaking it up on how we think about different parts of the start and um you know just in 10 seconds a lot can change so i think it's it's kind of fun to write this out and what your focus is is based on what your job is on the boat and i think if there were if we had like a graphic overlaid on this this flowchart of all times you'd see that like we go from big picture we're looking at the race course from like five minutes to three minutes you're still in the like gathering information phase thinking about your game plan what you're gonna do what's changing what's happening and then really after like a minute our focus is totally on the boats around us like we're not necessarily locked in but at that point in terms of like we couldn't fail things were bad um but the focus is really on boat positioning you know so it shifts from like up the course to like just the boats around us because that's who we're racing at that time and not a whole lot matters um what steph is talking about the pressure for the start like that's usually a velocity or if there's a big angle change and that is um that affects our acceleration time but she wasn't talking about that in terms of like changing our game plan necessarily um because yeah full focus just on that positioning uh from that point on and stuff i think we also had a lot of success like in the last year and a half we we focused a lot on our starting um and when we broke everything down into a really clear division of labor you know um i do the st the timers or the timing and so like how i say the time every time has to be consistent it should be consistent um in terms of like time and distance that's like on my plate uh game plan is stephs and on this puppy shifty crazy days like i'll have um additional like timing check-ins where i'll ask like prompting questions to like check in with stuff like still same game plan do you still like the right are you still thinking we're going right um and so that's the only other thing i would add to this list which is very comprehensive you
