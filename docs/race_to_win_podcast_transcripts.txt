[Music] [Music] welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast I'm Julia Berg A Seattle sailor currently podcasting from Guam USA in the 2 years that the race cu's phone app has been out the most common question we've gotten is why can't I watch the replay on my phone the short answer is that Google Earth did not support mobile replays so that meant if we wanted to make some sort of mobile replay on your phone it wouldn't be in 3D and it would just kind of be a dumb down version of what you saw on your desktop so we all waited when Google announced it would no longer support Google Earth as a product it was time for RCU to invest in a new 3D replay provider called cesium cesium does work on mobile devices and lo and behold Race's mobile was born it's probably the biggest change that the app has gone through since its existence and we got everything in there just like the desktop versions the implications for this are huge everyone loves to debrief after a sailboat race right it's one of the best parts chatting with all your friends about who did what right who did what wrong who went this way should have gone that way missed that windshift and it's way more fun fun to debrief when you have something to look at when you have actual evidence now in the good old days you know 6 months ago you would have had to go up to the bar get your computer get it all out get it all fired up and then you could watch your race replay and chat about it with whoever was sitting next to you things are a lot different now the replays are right in your mobile phone that means that you can do the deef as soon as the race is finished let's take a quick look and I'll show you what I'm talking about the mobile version of race cu's is exactly the same as a desktop version you have all the analytics race setup match mode different views it's all there of course it looks a little bit different on each device the best thing to look at it with is the new iPad Pro because of its incredibly powerful processor but you can watch 3D replays on most iPhones iPads and all the modern Androids to show you how this all works I'm going to use the 2015 Lipton Cup rata Sir Thomas Lipton was a self-made man who eventually became among other things a tea Baron lipon tea sound familiar he donated a number of race trophies to different sports um around the world during his time he was also a competitor in several America's cups but the Lipton Cup in specific was donated to the Sand Diego yach club and the first race was held in 1914 the format has changed manytimes times over the years but at the moment what they're doing is using a fleet of j15s all of the boats are meant to be the same it's one design racing and just to keep it extra Fair each team isn't assigned a boat for the entire rata instead after every single race they actually pull up to a floating dock in the middle of the harbor and they change boats and they do it really quickly grab their sunscreen grab their personal items the whole crew runs over to the next boat takes about 5 minutes um it's a pretty unique format Let's uh take a look at this rata using the race cu's mobile replay which I'm looking at here on my iPad 2 all right so here we are in the pre-art of the first race of the lifting cup and I have San Diego Yacht Club selected who was the host for this race it took place in San Diego and the Saint Francis Yacht Club who was a very stiff competitor uh in this regard St Francis is from San Francisco I was actually just there at the St Francis Yacht Club so I have to throw in a gratuitous picture or to from jfest um absolutely beautiful both great places there in California so here they are getting ready to start their first race St Francis and San Diego Yacht Club both very confident remember these are like the top amateur Sailors from these clubs down here both at the pin end and let's get a little closer view here okay so San Diego had a slightly better start just a little bit so they are ahead it's pretty much neck and neck so St Francis knows that they are behind and when San Diego tacks to cover the fleet St Francis goes out here on a flyer gets lots and lots of clear air and is just way out there by himself so now let's see what happens Here Comes The Moment of Truth they made it just a couple meters ahead if they hadn't been able to get in front of those boats look at how badly they would have gotten stomped on so St Francis is first around the mark as they head off downwind and these boats it's just so competitive I mean they are sailing so well so close together you'll see them just kind of Trading Places the whole time it's like just watching virtuosos at work now as they get down to the bottom gate here St Francis is going to take that favored gate on the left hand side and San Diego will choose the other gate they both head back up wind and you can see look at that San Diego did you see that lift oh my gosh go back this is what happens when you're reviewing these things you're watching it really fast and then you just see something amazing and you have to rewind and take a look so let's slow this down a little bit and so they're about 57 meters apart and St Francis has tacked over San Diego is coming and just watch this look at that curve to their track look at that lift that's incredible now it stands to reason that they might have had some local knowledge here because that is one heck of a lift and they are going to have to just duck right behind oh look at that St Francis taxs right on top of him said says take that and San Diego goes no way I'm out of here and he's going to head um out towards the lay line and let's see what happens here so they're really just kind of neck and neck coming St Francis is still well ahead now St Francis goes on to end up winning this race but San Diego Yacht Club actually wins the rata and if you want to you can review the rest of these replays and you'll see that San Diego Club seems to have consistently better speed downwind or at least that was our analysis they can drive a little bit deeper and still keep their speed up so as they come into the Finish um I think pretty sure this is what this is obviously we don't have the dock in our replay but you're going to see them all Bunch up together and stop and it looks to me like this is where they are switching boats [Music] going to switch boats get a new one head off and they do this all in about five minutes uh really fast and pretty soon they are off for the second race the point is this is really cool and it's really cool to be able to see it on your iPad or your phone right when you get back to the dock oh so one more thing I want to make sure you know how to find your replay at the moment you can't get to the replay right from the app that would be cool and we're working on it but what you do is you have to click the replay link like you would have clicked on your computer so in this case the lipin race replays are posted on the San Diego yach Club website so I access them there now if I was in a race and I was recording I would just go to rc.com on my phone in the browser or my iPad open up my account and click on the replay that I wanted so now that you know how to do it go out there have fun and I'll see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our

[Music] in this video I'm going to go over how to add marks to your Pebble Watch app so that you can use the navigation features there are four different ways to add navigation points in the Pebble Watch app the first method is to drop a mark this is where you push a button on the watch when you sail near your RAC Mark the second way is automatic Mark detection when you are racing the app detects when you round the Winward and lur marks the first and second methods are designed for boo racing using temporary marks with that in mind all dropped and automatically generated marks expire and disappear at midnight local time lured marks or you can choose to upload Lo permanent marks in two different ways either using the race cu's Mark upload where you export marks from a replay or a GPX file upload which is something for people familiar with GPX files so I'm going to explain these in more detail starting with the first method which is to virtually drop a mark while you are sailing so the way this works is you sale to the mark and on your watch go to the navigate to screen you can find this from the main menu or if you are already sailing you can take a shortcut by pushing the select button from your race dashboard screen make sure the Ping new Mark option is highlighted and when you sail near your mark press the select button this tells the watch to Ping your GPS location and record your position as a mark this Mark will show up as a new numbered entry in your watch 0 1 002 Etc so now you know how to add marks by pinging them when you're actually Sailing by pushing a button on your watch the second way to get marks into your watch app is automatic race Mark detection this method uses a proprietary algorithm from race cues that automatically detects when you round a race Mark automatic marks are really useful for buoy races when you don't know where the marks will be in order for this to work you need to have the wind direction properly set during your starting sequence this is a natural part of the process if you're using the watch to go sailboat racing because the watch will prompt you several times during the starting sequence to set the wind direction the wind direction doesn't need to be that accurate but you also have to make sure the watch knows you're racing in order for that to happen you need to complete a starting SE sequence basically you have to set a start time and let the watch count down as if you're starting the race once it reaches zero the watch will know that you're racing if the app doesn't think you're racing it has no idea where the Mark should be since you're probably not sailing directly up wind to your mark so assuming you've followed everything you're racing the wind is set every time you round a Winward or lward Mark a new Mark will be automatic Ally generated in the list they will be numbered w001 for Winward Mark 1 or LM followed by a number for lured marks okay so now we've learned how to manually drop the marks or how to let the app automatically create them if you are racing and have set the win Direction in the app if you know your marks in advance you can upload permanent marks to the watch app there are two different ways to get set these permanent marks in a form that your watch will understand one way is to go into your race cu's journal and Export marks from a previous race the other way is just any GPX file and this is for GPX file users that maybe create their marks in some other sort of software or on their handheld GPS so let me walk you through exporting and uploading marks off of a previous race cues course open a race cues replay and create your marks in the race cues course setup or you can use marks you have already created in another race once you see all the marks that you want to use use the export marks to GPX file option and make sure to note the location that you save it to on your computer next go back into your racec journal page on the computer click on this drop- down arrow symbol next to your name and select my marks follow the instructions on the screen to upload the marks using the file you've created earlier now the marks file is in your race cu's account but you need to be logged into your account in order for those to get to your watch so go to your phone and find the race cu's app inside the pebble time phone app go to settings and log to raceu just as always if you have a racec email and password that you use to log in use that or if you've always logged in with Facebook just click the log in with Facebook option once you're successfully logged in your marks will appear in your watch app for all of our racers in the United States I want you to know that all government marks are in the race cues replay system if the race committee publishes the mark locations Before the Race simply open any replay and navigate to the geographic location you'll see the permanent marks in this area as a small red dot that's just a placeholder for the mark position then you need to zoom in and drop a race course mark from race cues on top of the placeholder so that it's added to your marks list then you can export it like we talked about before if you're someone that is familiar with GPX files then you can use your own tool to create a GPX file of the marks as Waypoint WPT entries examine a sample uploaded from race cues to work out the required attributes once you have your GPX file follow the instructions that I just gave for using the race cu's my marks option on your journal page to upload the GPX file you will stay logged into to the watch app and anytime you upload a new marks file here that file will be the marks listed on your watch one more tip you can have as many marks in here as you want but they're not going to do anything unless you pick one to navigate to the app is pretty smart but it's not going to try to guess where you're going we thought we'd leave something for you to do after all give the marks a navigation a try and please let us know if you feel that we can make any improvements to this beta software by using the race cu's beta Pebble testing page on Facebook Facebook using the Race's Pebble beta discussion pages on the Race cu's forum or by emailing us at support rc.com

Transcript:
from the beginning of this startup we envisioned race queues as more than just a sailing app we wanted to take things a step further and give people hints or cues about how to improve their performance Wow they were actually racing that's why we called our app race queues but getting those queues too busy sailors in a meaningful way has proven to be tricky let me introduce you to a longtime race ques user who is testing one of our newest products meets failure Sally Sally has been sailing for quite a while and knows how important it is to have tactical analysis while you're racing Sally has used sailing apps on her smartphone and even tried strapping the phone to her wrist but her phone isn't that waterproof it's kind of delicate and really it just got in the way Sally needs a better device to give her tactical analysis while she's racing but still fits into her budget so Sally is beta testing a new tactical sailing watch app from rescues the app is free and it works with her crowdfunded durable and waterproof pebble smartwatch that she bought starting at just 80 bucks Sally is racing today so she puts her phone down below within Bluetooth range of her watch the phone does all of the complex tactical calculations and sends the information right to Sally's Pebble watch Sally sets the starting line and uses the starting computer to find out if the line is biased and if she's going to be on time for her start it's just one minute before the start and Sally is approaching the line suddenly her watch vibrates and lets her know that she's going to be over the line early Sally makes an adjustment and has a great start Sally also gets alerts when there's a wind shift and when the boats course is unsteady while she is racing Sally can see her racing dashboard which shows her speed vmg course and distance to the mark the app knows the marks because Sally uploaded them to her phone before the race Sally doesn't have to worry about over standing the mark because her watch buzzes and alerts her when she's approaching the ley line the navigation feature works best in distance races where you know the placement of the marks in advance the app has been recording all of Sally's tacking angles and will make some calculations and try and attempt to take any recent current into account of course it's important to remember that the app is still in beta testing that's why it's free and we need your help to make it better we want you to download the app and try it out if you have ideas for improvement or things that you don't understand you can talk about it on the race queues pebble app Facebook group or email support at race queues calm in summary let me explain why this app is so much different most phone apps and watches just give you raw information like your speed tacking angles things like that we take that information calculate it and turn it into an actionable item like an alert so for example instead of telling you the wind speed we tell you when there's a wind shift information that you need when you need it the pebble app always defaults to your sailing dashboard the dashboard is easy to see in the Sun water proof and the watch is affordable for more advanced users you can set up the perfect start to get your time and distance to the start or activate the navigation features to get distance to the mark layline alerts and way more if you're ready to take your tactics to the next level go ahead and get out your smartphone and type in race cues calm / smart - watch into your internet browser you can also find this link on our Facebook page that'll take you to our beta testing page where you can click the link to download the race cues app to the pebble time app on your phone please remember that since this app is still in beta testing you will not be able to find it by searching in the regular pebble app store you need to follow the directions on this page good luck and please let us know how you like it see you on the water

Title: 41 - The Bavaria Cup, and Wind Algorithims

Transcript:
[Music] [Music] welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast I'm Julio Berg A Seattle sailor currently podcasting from Guam USA here at race cues we have recently updated some of the wind features in our 3D replays to help EXP explain how it all works I'm going to use this popular race SL Cruise called the Bavaria cup the Bavaria cup format is a unique Riata format that's been spreading throughout Europe over the last couple of years the concept of the Bavaria cup is you have a onesign fleet that races during the day and then stops in a Marina and sleeps on the boat at night it's basically a very civilized distance race there are many of these uh radas throughout Europe but the Bavaria cup takes place in Croatia which is they call the country of hundreds of islands uh it is the ocean but it feels more like a bay because it's protected by all these islands in the warm Adriatic Sea they typically see winds from about 10 to 20 knots every day and this rata is sailed again as a multi-day onesign rata with two divisions One Division has about 20 Bavaria 40s and the other one has about 20 batow first 35s each with about eight crew members one of the neat things about this format is that because you have eight people on a boat it's a very affordable vacation uh race cues has sent teams to this three years in a row and we estimate the cost to be just under $1,000 for each crew member which includes food lodging race fees and the event dinners at night so from a vacation standpoint it's a pretty good deal now you might be wondering what kind of people show up to these things The Fleets are really competitive there are usually several professional teams and a lot of good Sailors and this every day the entire flotilla races between marinas in just this incredibly Scenic Adriatic Sea setting however there are lots of different levels of sailors and there's room for anyone to go and improve now one that's coming up is the three countries we it's the same kind of format but they're racing from Slovenia to Venice and as of this publication it looks like they still do have some room left and for €1,100 they will put you on a boat with a pro if you want a list of more races go ahead and send me an email it's julia. rcu.com and I'd be happy to send you a list of some more and one thing we're really curious about at race cues is if you know of any one design chartered radas outside of Europe are there other places that are doing this not handic cap races uh we're just interested in one design so if you know of anything again please send me an email and I'll put my email address again at the end of the podcast okay so here's the start of the one of the Bavaria Cup races on day three you can see we have the wind right here it's these little floating arrows and above it is the direction the initial Direction before the race is set is 70° now race cues determines that using meteorological data historical data from that day which depending on the source and where you're sailing may or may not be that accurate if you need to adjust it it's really simple we have this new wind button on the dashboard here just click on it and you can adjust the initial wind direction here one of the ways you can tell if you weren't sure is generally the wind should be pretty Square to the starting line right so we'll leave that at 70° you can also toggle those wind arrows on and off if you don't want to see them so the racing begins and race huse has a proprietary algorithm that is able to figure out the average wind direction for the race course and this is pretty tricky uh we're the only that we know of Replay engine that's trying to do this to estimate it and the thing is we're pretty good at it because look at all the data that we have we have all these boats and the the assumption that we make is that the boats are trying to race they're they're trying to get up wind at some point in this Riata so we can analyze the talking patterns and tell where the wind is coming from for each boat in the fleet so what you're seeing here is an average wind direction for the race course obviously there is no true wind direction even for one boat it's going to be different at the top of the mass than it is at the bottom of the mass different on the left side of the course different on the right side of the course but this is the average that we see as calculated across all these boats so the more boats that are recording the more accurate this wind direction is going to be so you can see we're starting to see a slight right shift here um 81 82 and as the race goes on so as the boats are going we start to see a wind shift and as the wind shifts the lay lines to the Mark will actually move in the replay and you can see how that's going to affect the different position of different boats in the f you can see them swinging back and forth right here now things get a little bit tricky if the boats sail for a long ways downwind the wind predictions can get a little bit inaccurate because remember we are assuming that you're always trying to sail as close to the wind as possible so on a distance race if there's a long reaching leg the wind angle can get a little bit off and if that happens it's really easy to fix it you can see this was really a long reaching leg so maybe if I notice things don't look quite like they should I can just click on the arrow and manually adjust everything here easy peasy I hope that helps you uh understand how the wind Works a little bit better it's really a great tool to help you evaluate kind of what was going on with your racing especially in relation to working those shifts and understanding what might have been a better position for your boat at different places in the course happy sailing and I'll see you on the water if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www.rac.com [Music] podcast

welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast the entire point of sail boat racing is to push the limits and to get better every time well this is really fun occasionally there can be some unfortunate consequences if you haven't run aground while racing yet believe me you will you're looking at the Jazz Cup which is a classic race in San Francisco Bay 26 miles it's usually downwind here from San Francisco over to benicia let's take a look at the big picture here roughly halfway through the race you have boats again starting in San Francisco trying to get around here to benicia but you have a massive massive abhorrent a couple of knots going against these guys so right now they're hiding behind point st. Pablo and then in Richmond here and as they get around it there actually is sort of a back Eddy bouncing off of the point so the idea is hide behind the point and then get around it and maybe getting into this counter current Eddie the problem is that also over here it is very shallow so it got a little bit tricky that day for some of these boats let's take a look at what happens to these guys they're all kind of bunched together trying to get around the point here and as they start going boom central miglia a ground oh no shameless stopped as well libro manages to sneak by just oh my gosh sweating bullets literally they draw a lot less than either of those two boats and then here you can see clean sweep goose they were right there with libra but they went wide at the point so this was one of those races where it was really important to be able to get inside of the current and not have to go out against all that hard stuff I'll tell you what it is about running the ground nobody wants to talk about it he will pretend it didn't happen my own father won't even talk to me on my podcast about his recent crowding so I to really give a big hand to will Paxton well was sailing on sento meglio and is the only person that agreed to talk to me on the record about this day keep in mind we're not recording the entire fleet here and quite a few boats ran aground that day when you say will there was many of the ran aground of that race right I think a few of them might have kept those tracks private for this one but anyways obviously you never want to run aground but if you do you want to be able to get out of there quick and recover so thank you so much will your awesome sorry that I found your hidden track for this race and I'm making you talk about it so anyways what happened I we know it's completely my fault for running aground and I just want to emphasize the fact that you know whenever you're doing a race like that make sure you're sailing on a boat where you trust the instruments you know to the point where you if you get it you're getting on a strange boat and you're in charge of the navigation you know get a spinnaker sheet and a winch handle and you know test test the depth sounder you know is it is it from the bottom is it from the surface is it from the bottom of the keel owner doesn't quite remember who knows you make sure that you know that that instrument is giving you valid data super important and not to call you out well and thanks again so much for talking to me but when did you say you have local knowledge of this particular area I do and in that particular race I ran aground on the spot where I've laughs two people running aground for being silly they're a ton of times and the funny thing was is in that in that race it was really light air so we got closer in there than I've ever been before why would light air make you do that oh just because you usually sue windy you wouldn't trying and cut that close but in slow motion it's easier to cut close you know usually running aground in a race is usually a little low speed incident especially if you're sailing in a tie any kind of title area right because if it's windy that tied disadvantage isn't going to be as big of a deal as when you're going really slow in light air so I guess it makes you more likely to do something a little bit riskier because the advantage is so much bigger so talk to me about what happened when you ran aground and you know how do you get out of this well usually what happens in light error is your you're healed to lured for starters which makes it really bad because when you realize that you've run aground the boat stops and because you'll lose all your apparent wind the boat stands up and all of a sudden you know you here we went from drawing six feet to drawing seven feet so now you're really stuck in the mud and you have no momentum and you have no apparent wins so you you have to you need to react immediately because it gets worse the longer that you sit there so first thing that you want to do is you hopefully the deeper water is is back the way you came so you want to attack immediately and tap and when you tack you want to back when the jib is you want to force the boat around back the way you came on the other tax that you want to back when the jib you want to heal the boat over you want to put everyone out on the boom oh yeah we were we were the race was almost out of stop at that point we were in a desperate position and not lose any places so I actually sent somebody out to sit on the out on that spinnaker halyard because you have more leverage from the top of the mass fortunately for us there was a photographer there from the sailing website pressure drop who captured this truly awesome moment and of wills escape well in this case it wasn't the heaviest person on the boat but obviously want to send the heaviest person possible well she's also the avi the bow girl so she was already she was quick with the harness and everything and got out there and as you know we kept working it harder and harder to tip the boat over and slowly started the boat moving towards deeper water as she kept yelling to get pulled up because of the boat wasn't tipping over increasingly and dipping her in the water and she had her phone in her pocket so she kept screaming help lets you pick the little higher that was pretty funny well certainly made some pretty awesome photos actually went viral on Facebook the next day so okay you got out of it by basically tipping the boat over what are some other methods that you've used or that you could recommend to people that really get stuck if you're really if you're really stuck you know the anchor is a is the only way you're going to get off without somebody telling you off it's like last resort so like I said I've been in situations where we took the anchor and we tied it to a fender so if someone could swim it out without it sinking them and then untie it and then winching the boat out or using the or you could attach it to a holler to the top of the mast it's another thing that you could do to chip tuck in you're just trying to tip the boat over because you know everyone's like oh well you'll break the mask but not really if you think about if you wipe out with your sticker in 25 knots of breeze the boats flogging and all the cruise on the rail and rigs whipping that's an awful lot of load on things so I just you that the the mass can take you know all the load in the world to tip the boat over on its side in most cases and also you know the anchor is your friend when you're sailing in those shallow waters and you know probably if the wind is shutting down you know the next step beyond sailing really close to the shore is anchoring so we always make sure it's a mercy obey that our anchor is really ready to go all the coils are always flaked we actually tie up the chain and the rope with yarn so you know you're like okay quick anchor we're in the spot you know it's one pulls a thing out and it's in a big not know you're going to go backwards a couple hundred yards before you get the anchor out so and you know the anchor is your friend and part of your race equipment she always have it ready so know that one of the ways you can help yourself legally get ungrounded as will call it is by using your sales while you're racing uh do you have any tips for that I mean is there a better way to trim it to help that be more effective how do you trim it well you just hope that it fills and you're trying to basically trying to cause a crash cause around up and cause the boat to tip over um like I said it's really difficult to make that happen sometimes because most groundings in races occur in light air where there's not a lot of wind and it gets exponentially worse when you come to a stop when the boat stands up and the keel digs into the soft mud or sand so you really really want to react quickly spin the boat and attack you back when the jib you get all the crew weight possible lured and you do everything possible to get out of there thank you again so much well for agreeing to talk to us and giving us all those great tips also a big thank you to pressure drop for the use of their awesome photos and to all the other photographers whose pictures I've used you can source them if you want to learn more I hope that everyone has a great couple of weeks sailing and I'll see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast I can find more on our website WWE use calm / podcast

Title: Podcast 39 - The Great Handicap Debate

Transcript:
welcome back to race to win sailing podcasts today I'm going to introduce you to one of the newest features of the race cues 3d replay which is our handicapping feature boats racing in a one design fleet don't use a handicap because it's just the same type of boats racing against each other whoever crosses the finish line first wins simple as that however many fleets around the world are a mixed fleet with different types of boats racing against each other all on the same race course sailors want to be evaluated on their skill level not necessarily on the inherent speed of their model of boat so the handicaps are in place to try to make it more fair when you cross the line in the handicapped race you usually might have some idea where you placed but you really don't know how you did in the race until the committee boat posts the corrected results after everyone's finished and everything is calculated or at least that's how it used to be to race queues handicap systems give you corrected time results in the replays and live broadcast as soon as your boat crosses the finish line this is 1ph RF division of a race in San Francisco Bay as each boat finishes their corrected time is visible let's compare that to the race committee results that came out an hour later if you've set up the race correctly the results should be correct within 5 seconds the major factor in the variability is the location of the phone on your boat or small errors in the phone GPS the race cues handicaps are intended to be used as a backup this is not something that you should use in a protest situation in fact the rules of sailing require that a actual person records race finishing times they are not allowed to become collected by a computer if you see that your finish times are significantly deviating from the race committee results think about what goes in to the calculation for that particular handy cap it's simple math and we're all using the same formula so compare the finish times between the race Q's and the committee times the elapsed time and then the ratings to make sure that everything has been input correctly in regular leg by leg analysis it's really hard to tell which leg was successful if you're sailing in a handicapped fleet but with the new handicap calculations the smoke-and-mirrors is all gone so check it out here we can see that huge who took second place sail this leg quite a bit slower however in corrected time you can see that they actually made out on this leg correcting sailing 30 seconds faster so how does it work first off the race needs to be set up when you're setting up a start you enter the time and now you have an option to choose from a list of available handicapping system after the starts are set up and a handicap has been identified make sure that all the boats in each fleet have a handicap entered in the system if they don't have one you can just click on the boat name and enter it here of course ideally you should have your boat set up on your journal page including the boats picture but if someone forgot to do that just help them out by putting in their rating for them now there is no ideal handicap system every single one has its faults and there are dozens of various systems as you can see listed here there are two basic conceptual approaches to calculating sailboat racing handicaps time on time and time on distance time on distance which is more popular in North America calculates boat handicaps based on the mileage length of the race handicap systems based on the time on time concept are becoming more popular around the world and have long been in use in Europe to make a time on time handicap calculation you don't need to know the distance of the race the calculations are based on the elapsed time of each boat I'm not going to go into too much more details about the different types of rating systems you understand the two basic models when you're playing around reviewing your replay one of the things that can be kind of fun although completely irrelevant is to see if the final results would have been any different if the race was scored using a different handicap method let me show you what I mean here are the top three boats from a recent race in San Francisco Bay heading out around the racecourse if we go ahead and skip to the end of the replay by clicking on the timeline we can see that the winner was headrush so a big congratulations to them now they beat the next boat warp speed by about a minute and beat the third boat l2o by about a minute and a half we can actually click on the corrected time here and see that this race was scored using the pH RF time on distance method this is the method that was in the CLN instructions and chosen by the race committee so headrush won the race it doesn't matter what we do after this but just for fun it can be interesting to see how race standings change using a different handicapping method in order to do that you edit the start we only have pH RF ratings entered for these boats so we need to pick a pH RF system so instead of time on distance let's score this with pH RF time on time save if we go back over to our race standings we can see now l2o has won the race headrush a second and warp speed is third well that's pretty interesting and I think I know why let's take a look at this again we've got three boats they're rating 123 l2o 75 for headrush and the other top boat was this boat warp speed 54 so look at this going upwind they were all going really well I can tell by the colors of the speeds trail that's high speed coming back downwind oh no they're all going really slow well that doesn't make any sense except for I happen to know that this is San Francisco Bay which has crazy current there was actually a - not current running against them going downwind so the race goes on they're gonna go around again same thing happens we can take a look at the stats for this last leg the distance it's only about a mile and a half if you calculate just from mark to mark however because they're sailing into the current although they only went a mile and a half over the ground they sailed a lot further actual distance than that through the water this particular race was using the time on distance pH our F rating system that's popular in North America but the distance that they're calculating it with is too low because the boats actually sailed farther when they were all sailing up in this current so that means that boats that rate faster have an advantage because they're not going to take as much of a hit on that handicap mileage calculation a lot of fleets around North America are trying to change to time on time for reasons like I've mentioned here but anyways this is just sort of a fun exercise here are the actual results as you can see again congratulations to headrush on winning this race one more quick tip for you remember that in order to see the corrected time you need to click to the end of the time line Here I am in the middle of the race I'm gonna see live results if I click past the finish line I'll see the finish times so get out there have some fun hopefully let's not start too many arguments about which rating system that we should be QC but I think you guys are really gonna enjoy this none of this is gonna work if your fleet is not using race queues so remind everybody to use the app it's free really easy and everyone learned something from watching their race replay see you on the water if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website WWE use calm slash

Transcript:
[Music] [Music] welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast here at race cues we've gotten quite a few questions about using race cues in protest hearings people wonder is race cues admissible how accurate is it what kind of experiences have other people had the answer is a little bit complicated let's start by heading over to Norway where we're going to watch a mark rounding video recorded by a judge on the committee boat of a regular Wednesday night Sailboat Race 213 entering three boat lengths is clear alar passes now it's a protest the is talking about the three booat length Zone which is referenced in international sailing rule 18.2 B basically the rule says when boats are approaching the mark there is a three booat length Zone around the mark when the first boat touches that zone if another boat is overlapping them the boat the inside boat has rideway around the mark but of course it's a bit more complicated than that overlap is established at the moment that the first boat touches the outside of that three boo link Zone any overlap that happens after that doesn't count and if there's no overlap that boat that's trying to sneak in the inside does not have rideway and will lose in a protest situation so take a look at odard here in this boat with the black and white Spiner who believes he has overlap against Fu Vista here oldv oldv oldv oldv no no no no no that's a big mistake well I think it's pretty obvious what the judge thinks about this situation um we odard is a advid race cu's user and contacted us about using rescues in this protest situation so let's hear it from him okay U my name is odad munes and I was sailing my boat hexpress on this Wednesday rays and the light the conditions were very light although it seems clear in the video at least from this angle that oddvar did not have overlap he felt that the race Q's GPS track told a different story because if you if you look at the the track you can see how fist is maneuvering when he gets close to the mark and that's open that opened the door for me to go on the inside so this is also very educational for for uh for for the three boat boat length zone now the the boat length Zone on on this on this playback is not 100% correct because the boats the boats are 26 ft and the the Avatar is for an Express 27 so the boat or the circle is drawn about 1 meter wrong so for our purposes we decided to assume that the three boo length Zone Circle in the replay should be a little bit smaller that's where where he is touching and then if you draw a perpendicular line from the stone you see that it hits my boat midship right there so I was in the right and that is what I argued against but they told me that they wouldn't even look at it because in a protest they say that it's not uh admissible so we started talking about GPS accuracy when you you're looking at a race cu's GPS track unfortunately cell phone GPS's just aren't that accurate we figure the margin of air is about plus or minus 3 m so up to 6 M let me show you an example here's a track from somebody's race on San Francisco Bay see these two boats it looks like it's two race boats doing the exact same thing however it's actually two phones on the same boat see how far apart they are the race cu's Avatar is calculated based on the fact that you have placed your phone in the exact center of the boat but in reality you might have it at the helm or you might have it in your bag down below at the bow so that's just one of the factors that creates this margin for error in the race cu's GPS tracks that margin makes it difficult to use unsupported tracks as evidence for close Maneuvers in protest hearings luckily ORD had a video to support his track and let's go back and hear his explanation of how he actually does see an overlap in the video the individual positions of the boat is uh is such that I have overlap over the boat in front of me and uh it's hard to see from the angle that the video is shot that this uh overlap has been established uh the judge ruled against me or he said that it was inadmissible for me to to say and they judged the situation based upon the video as it is and it was hard for them to see that I had overlap at that particular time even though the replay is isn't that accurate as far as distance we can still look at the relative positions and angles of the boats look at the way Fu Vista is angled towards the mark and odard is coming down about at midships right when they reach that three boo length Circle which remember is actually a little smaller than we see in the replay now look at the video again this video is shot from an angle that creates an issue with depth of field we perceive that the boat are closer together than they actually are and are pointed in the same direction let me draw you the actual angles the boats are at and you can see what odard was thinking here from his angle he is headed right at the midship of Fu Vista and actually there may have been an established overlap this is a perfect example of the best use for race Hues at a protest hearing which is a supporting evidence although we can't see exactly where the boats were we can see their relative positions and their movements over time for protests that involve longer incidents rescues becomes even more valuable good luck out there thank you so much to ARD beress for his time and all of his help with this podcast and if you caught a cool situation using race cuu I would love to hear from you see you next time [Music] if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on

Transcript:
welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast today we were back in San Francisco Bay with Alex Wong from the Sequoia Yacht Club and he's agreed to share with us a video from his boat showing some common tacking mistakes and then we're gonna show you what a great tack should look like I myself was actually there for this race I wasn't on Alex's boat l2o I was racing on another boat and had a great time after the race this coil Yacht Club shows the replay up on the big screen well everyone eats just amazing food best food I've ever had in my life and they were also looking at a video of some of the things that had happen Alex's boat l200 was a well sailed boat but on this particular day they were missing a crew member so everyone had to switch around and do different jobs or as we say the crew was out of position this resulted in a lot of common mistakes that we see in less experienced crews that we can share with you for example here they are approaching the windward lay line they tack and then just get into all kinds of trouble with an override we got a lot on the line out there we had a overly fast turn so he had the gym out flapping around and ever he's looking at that it's making a lot of noise and distracting them so they're not seeing that the red line is about to get sucked in there goes like just about gets sucked in there now he could get a better video net lots of different factors that can happen perfectly good sailors and and then disaster just just here we go the first step to clearing an override is to remove the winch handle it just gets it out of the way and also when the override does clear you don't want that to pop out and go overboard instead of unwinding the first thing I always try to do is grab whichever end is free and pull up sharply without the winch handle in a lot of times that will break the whole thing loose and off you go at this point l200 is still passed the ley line but finally they get the override undone and they start grinding in the jib oh this is this is our our spinnaker trimmer and he is grindin he's determined to get that thing in because we were yelling at a Marriott very effort listen we're losing boat lengths well boom grinds the not all the way into the block we just rip the knot off and this is a very slow-moving well now you see proof of why everyone's always saying tie the ball and as close as you can to the chip and Alex had a little confession to make so they're not was a little bit of the culprit so yours truly tied that knot it it should have been quite a feminism it was a ball win and it was it was kind of it was kind of long and I'm kind of glad it was because if it wasn't that long we had parted he might have just kept grinding and toward the bottom of the sail in half - so lots of things happening there now that the knots broken loose they have to tack over onto the other side and as you can see from the graphic there's just sailing the completely wrong direction at this point long past the ley line there rerunning the jib sheet getting the knot retied on the other side and then they're finally going to tack over and be heading the right direction when this trouble all started it was at about 40 828 when they first got that override and now we can see that by the time they're going the right direction again the time stamp is about 50 minutes 20 seconds so they've lost almost two minutes because of this series of tacking mistakes Alex and I looked at this together and talked a bit about what he thought caused this problem again before all of this started you got to think about what causes of getting one my pick person was not in the pit so they weren't watching the lines secondly well it really had to do with the fact that the release was happening at the long time and my that the driver actually was rather new and he turned way too fast and he didn't have somebody that was being aggressive entailing the the new sheet coming in and he even if they did that would have stuck that red line in anyway one of the main issues with mistakes for Alex this day was that his crew was out of position now this is it good to the good chance for them to cross train and practice other positions of course having consistent crew is so important for a successful racing program and this is a pretty good example of what happens when life gets in the way and people have to do things they're not used to doing let's take a look at another tack this time again they're approaching the windward mark and they run into some more problems more than more than anything else look at look at the sail it's out there it's out 45 degrees so it was a the Helms gonna obviously turned too fast and instead of helping the trimmers out with this big sail it sails way out there they're gonna have to haul all that stuff in well in hauling all that in the tail of the spinnaker sheet that was sitting on the on the lifeline got sucked in so I'm looking at there going what's going on why is this not coming and we're pulling on this thing we're yanking on it and would look back and go oh that's what's going on that doesn't look right at all okay so obviously they're not going to get that one undone very easily now there's a big ol knot and it's about four full wraps of spinnaker spinnaker sheet in there with the jib sheet and they're going well we can grind it out well that's pretty much the wrong impulses I'd do anything and they're saying they're okay they're gonna try to unwrap the green jib sheet but instead of trying to take the winch handle out they're trying to do with the winch handle in again and we're making a lot easier just take the winch handle out but it will live with this one so next thing we're gonna try to do is try to get that gorgonian knot off it's really it's just it's just Hank that's looped through itself on on the lifeline it's pretty close to the jib winch but this has never happened before we continue to struggle to get that knot undone for almost a full another minute and you can see on the replay there is a potential crossing situation there the other boats on starboard they're on port but it looks like there are gonna pass clear ahead here they have the time to get it undone Alex almost got the knife out the Quetta is new spinnaker sheet but it all turned out fine and now finally they're gonna be able to get tacked over and headed the right direction so let's take a look at how long this costume so here's the start of that first tack at about one hour 12 minutes 20 seconds and by the time they get it all straightened out they've sailed far past the delay line they get tacked over it again at about 1 hour 14 minutes 47 seconds so it's almost two and a half minutes that they lost Plus now they've gone past the ley line even with these mistakes l2o still didn't manage a fourth in this race they got out the next week and they had everybody in their proper positions and we'll show you what a good tak look like there are five basic steps to a good tack preparation the pre release the release the fast grind and the fine-tune trimming so when you're preparing for a tack you should clear the working sheet remove the winch handle and take off all the wraps but one at the same time the person who's going to be grinding should load up the winch and put in the handle next step is the pre release as the boat starts to turn let out just one foot of line the pre release is really important because it gets a big Genoa in front of the spreaders so that it can back win slightly and move quickly to the other side of the boat once you have that back wind you're at the release below the sheet off of the winch completely and make sure it runs free with a jib that's over 100 percent the humps person should slow the turn of the boat slightly to allow the team time to grind in the sail brings us to our next step which is grinding now if you do this right 90 percent of the line will already be trimmed in by hand when you're trimming in that sheet do it as fast as possible hand over hand once you get to grinding you want to make sure the grinders in a well-balanced position if you're grinders not huffing and puffing by the end of this they're probably not grinding as hard as they should be it's really important that when you're grinding the sail in you don't over trim you want to give the boat a chance to accelerate after the that brings us to the final step which is trimming so the easiest thing to do is to put marks with tape or a pen right on the sheet so that the grinder knows okay I grind to the red mark and then I'm gonna stop and bring it in slowly allowing the boat to accelerate finish up the tack by cleaning up the lines and putting the winch handle away do this right and you'll see a beautiful fast clean tack just like we saw here thank you so much Alex and the crew of LTO and hey I hope to see you guys again next time I'm in San Francisco thanks Julia hey this is a lot of fun yeah we've got some really strange things that happen in the next couple of weeks and I'd love to send you some of these clips things that you've been never imagine sounds good Alex thanks again and I will see you all next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website WWE use comm slash podcast

Transcript:
[Music] [Music] welcome back to race to win the saing podcast the whole point of race cues is to help you improve your performance and have more fun sailing So today we're going to be talking about online coaching using the race cu's geovid now if you're not familiar with a geovid you're looking at one right now it's just footage from an action camera like a GoPro that is time synced with the 3D replay it's an incredible tool for anyone to evaluate their own sailing and if you can get your footage into the hands of a pro like we did you can really learn a lot in this podcast we're sort of Epping on a coaching session between quantum spefic salemaker will Paxton and one of his customers Paxton kicks off the session by looking at the crew positions on the boat and talking about some ways to make the boat sail faster that people don't always think of okay I'm watching these guys sailing up wind um Everybody sitting on the rail there looks like now they're hiking when they heal over but you want to try and be consistent because the the balance of the boat and the balance of the helm is key with the crew hiking consistently so there's a lot of people uh what we call prairie dogging you got to try really hard to hunker down um and find your spot on the rail so it helps everybody be more consistent and one of the things we do on the express to make it more comfortable is everybody has padded hiking shorts as well so you can really get comfortable sit on the rail um we have nice custom pads which I see Ser is not yet but I know we have some on order that really helps a lot too you got to take care of your crew you know people come to me and they're like you know how much money can I spend on sales and low stretch ropes and all these other things and I first thing I want to do is go you know to go faster at winds first thing you do is go look at their boat at their lifelines do they have a big thick tow rail with no padding do they have wire with no paddings like the first thing you do to go faster up wind is make it more comfortable for your crew to hike on these little boats well doesn't like to toot his own horn but I'll tell you the guy wins a lot of races and he's not selfish about sharing his tips with the rest of his Fleet in fact this particular customer is actually races against will they both own Express 27s looking at the stats for this race you can see Libra which is the boat we're looking at here is really close to motorcycle Irene which is will but he just cannot quite get him what can he do to help find that Groove up wind finding your balance up wind um the simplest way to start is to have the jib trimmed in properly and the boat sailing upwind to the tell tails and you want the boat happily sailing up into the tell tails with the weather tell tailes lifting occasionally um without too much input from the helm if you need to point higher you need to get there by pulling the main in a little bit if you want to point a little lower you need to ease the main a little bit um and if it's not easy to find that happy place with only an inch or two of main sheet movement then that probably means you need uh more backstay the backstay will flatten the sales um giving a more forgiving entry and also twist the top of the main open which will give you more twist and less weather Helm and therefore more of a neutral Helm if the helm is too neutral and The Lure tell tail is flapping then you need more main sheet or perhaps more traveler up to help bring the bow back up these lines are called The Groove analysis lines and they basically analyze your boat handling and tell you when you're in the groove and when you're out now look at Paxton's lines it's like someone just took a ruler and drew a line right across using the groove of the entire time but our customer here is has some gaps so we looked at one of the gaps and I asked Paxon what happened here to cause this Gap and what can we do to have better boat handling and get a straight line okay so now as a coach I'm coming up on where Sergey is having a hard part you can see he just hits a wave right there and that is one of a gap in the Groove Line where he did not sail consistently so you can see as soon as he hit the wave the tiller started moving around more also his crew sat up on the rail which is going to make acceleration worse and also I did not he's got a fine tune on the main trim I did not see the main go in and out in anticipation or recovery um of the bad wave and the boat slowing down so you have to identify the wave is coming you have to hike hard and one of the tricks most small like keelboat is is when you come to the wave you generally want to come up the wave because you accelerate up the wave face and so you want to trim in because the boat will accelerate and point up the wave and as the bow exits out the top of the wave you want to ease the main and the boat will bear away again with very little input and drag from the rudder and accelerate um and that is the cleanest way to do it and it keeps the bow glued in the water and prevents what we call chopping wood which is when the bow pounds through the chop in the wave downwind the customer was really sailing pretty well but just kept losing overall time again just a little bit slower than Paxton so I asked him what do you see here coach what what can we do better okay let's see I see too many people in the back of the boat um and again you want it for stability which means less trimming and less driving you want to try and keep some weight low so usually we have one of the bigger guys is standing in the Companion Way hatch which kind of puts his weight down low just standing on the cooler of the floor and they can operate the four guys guy the Vang the twings um from there I say that trimmer should be standing further forward and the driver should be probably sitting uh in front of the traveler or up on the side deck straddling the traveler because you can see the waves you're trying to Surf better um another nice technique you can use on Express or other boats is a driver can also have the weather twing in his hand as well so if there's an opportunity to sail a little lower you can pull on the twing cuz it's a bow string angle you can square the pull back several inches which helps the boat bear off down a wave and then ease the swing up a little bit which helps the boat head up out of the wave um helps about accelerate sale a deeper vmg and again um you always looking to steer less and have less Rudder drag so they got just some little things to do they're sailing they're sailing pretty well sales are sheet pretty correctly um and they just really have some some little things to tidy up in the trade craft of how they're sailing their boat online racing coaching using geoids has an incredible amount of potential and lucky for you we are looking for some people to help us test this and at the moment it's a great way to

Transcript:
[Music] [Music] welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast today we're going to be talking about good seamanship if you spend enough time on the water racing sailing eventually you're going to find yourself in a situation where your skill and decisions are the difference between an emergency and just a good sea story I sat down with Bill Woodruff of San Francisco California to talk about a situation he encountered in his Catalina 30 so we were on the second day of our Vallejo race and we were experiencing yeah relatively heavy conditions for the San Francisco Bay the wind was sustained in the 20 to 25 knot range and we had gusts in the 25 to 30 knot range and given the wind direction we had a little bit more swell than what we normally see on the bay the waves aren't particularly large 2 or 3 feet but they're steep you're looking at the course from the 116th annual great Vallejo race a weekend event on the San Francisco Bay during the second day an upwind Crossing situation developed between our guest Bill's Boat named huge and another vessel so we're on starboard the other boat boats on Port they see us and we believe they're attempting to take our Stern as the two boats approach each other we realize they aren't going to make it they aren't going to be able to take our Stern and we decide to crash Tac so at that point we don't change anything with the sails we just turn the wheel over and try and get the boat pointed in the same direction as the boat that was going to impact us I believe that that maneuver was going to be successful that we were going to avoid any substantial contact between the two boats or if the two boats did hit they would hit side by side not a type of collision that I would expect to create a lot of damage on either boat after the crash tack um the other unfortunately the other boat continued to try and turn down and take our Stern so we weren't we didn't end up hitting parallel to one another we ended up hitting with the uh their boat at about 45° um to the side of our boat and the bow drove into the side about midships I asked Bill to explain what was happening on board when they realized that a collision was going to be imminent so at the time I had been sitting on the high side of the boat and I was trimming the main right and I'm trying to keep my weight out there are only four people on the boat and I'm keeping my head out of the boat doing tactics now we come to the point where the boat's going to hit us and we know contact's inevitable um I'm on the low side of the boat and I know I'm going to go into the water so I turn toward the water and I relax and my surfing instincts say take a deep breath of air because you're going in the water and I did so you've seen they've they've had a pretty serious Collision they've had people in the water this is definitely a situation that has the potential to become very tragic right so another member of my crew who was a little bit forward of me on the rail also went into the water we went under fortunately we weren't under for very long and the boat rolled back up so uh I shook the water off and we had obviously a crisis on our hands so I needed to get off the rail and the first thing we did is move into our go-to positions so goto positions there the spots where everybody is at their strongest I told to issue a pan pan on channel 16 because we knew we had taken very extensive damage but it that moment everybody on the crew was okay and the boat was floating we also called 911 and they alerted the Coast Guard and vessel assist and then we set about U surveying the damage so they pulled everything heavy from the port side of the boat at this point in the story a less Intrepid crew might have just kept the boat afloat and waited for help but the crew of huge was determined to save the boat what follows is an amazing example of seamanship with maybe just a dash of good luck so down below they're pulling the cushions and the boards and everything out of the way to get a look at the hole in the boat and we realize that the hole is extending quite a bit below the waterline I'm on the deck and I'm also looking over the side and I can see well down into the anif file a big crease in the side of the boat we realize that we have to stay on Port Tac we can't do anything about it and not only do we have to stay on Port Tac but we have to keep the sails trimmed up and we have to keep the boat healed over substantially we uh assessed the severity of the damage and we realized there was no way that the boat could sit level in the water because it would take on too much water and it would likely swamp and if we had to go over on starboard tack the boat was going to sink so we're really very limited in our options we're forced to stay on Port and healed over substantially I stay on Port attack and I start heading for the shore and my thinking at this point is either we're going to find a marina to put the boat in or I'm going to run the boat up on the mud but I'm going to do something to prevent U the boat from sinking out in the middle of the Bay and of course the main reason to save the boat is Bill is trying to protect his crew from the cold water of San Francisco Bay my thinking is that I'm going to put this boat up on the mud on its starboard side near the shore so on Port Tac we were U maybe a mile or so from the shore and as we're approaching the shore we see a Marina and that's a little bit of luck that's um that was a little bit of luck in the situation so we were able to stay on Port Tac and make a beine for the marina um we have a lot of trouble starting our motor which uh gives us you know quite a scare but eventually we're able to get the motor started and the Marina has a channel to get into it and we realized that we're going to have to just make a beline for the dock in the marina and we get to the channel entrance in a coordinated effort we drop the sails we motor in as fast as we possibly can and now we're really taking on a lot of water down in the buge this video looks a little confusing it's because the person holding the camera is actually hanging upside down trying to get a look at what's happening with the water coming inside the [Music] boat we pull a quick uturn and we tie up to the fuel dock and then we quickly take all the Howards on the boat and we hook the Howards onto the dock and we roll the boat over on its side again and with the help of the manual pump and the automatic build we kept the water out of the boat at least it never got up to the level of the engine so at that point the situation starting to stabilize we're at the dock we have the Howards uh holding the boat over on its side so the hole is up out of the water and at that point the Coast Guard showed [Laughter] up and vessel assist but um what happened then is is we began to clean up the boat and vessel ass cyst put a some sort of a putty I'm not familiar with what it is into the side of the boat and they puted up maybe about I don't know 12 or 18 inches up from the water um and it is able to harden in the presence of water and that stopped the worst of the leaking and the boat was towed to the yard to be repaired the following day when the Seas were calm my first question when I heard the end of the story was is it going to be okay after all this work are you going to be able to repair the boat or is it just a total write off so the the future of the boat um and this gets into your insurance question fortunately we had an agreed value for the boat which exceeded the value of the the cost of the repairs so the boat is going to be repaired and it should be done in the next week or so crew was fine one of the crew members was very shaken up U the other person that went into the water as I did but um they uh everybody seems to be fine so boat and crew are live to sail again Wikipedia defines seamanship as the art of operating a ship or a boat so with that in mind I'd like to thank Belle and his crew for sharing their seamanship Masterpiece with us and I know that I've certainly filed it away in my mental notes of if this happens to me this is how to do it right and I hope you do too stay safe out there and and I'll see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www.rac.com [Music] podcast

[Music] [Music] welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast I'm here with sailing champion and Quantum salemaker will Paxton good to talk to you again will hey Julia well this is uh the first race on Sunday of the resin rata and the day before had been blowing in the high 20 low 30s and it was very cold and wet and Smash and Crash kind of day on the circle and this day was threatening but didn't quite get as windy in the first race so we kind of reluctantly went racing uh at the top of the Genoa which was the right call it was flooding um the water was pretty flat it was blowing 12 or 13 um we actually held the Genoa for the entire race to get us started we're going to look at the first upwind leg of the course and we're going to take two boats Le Libra and motorcycle Irene which is Wills booat if you take a look at the leg stats here you can see that will had a faster elapse time 4% less and also sailed less distance so basically he was higher and faster the maximum RQ index is 100 and the higher your RQ the more stable your course the more that you were in the groove now it's impossible to get a hundred because of course sometimes you're going to be at the starting line or going around a mark So 88 is very good and and 72 is nothing to complain it either let's watch Libra sailing from the bow and it's very clear you can see this wavy colorcoded line behind is the GPS course and the straight line coming out is your groove analysis line it's basically the average of your GPS course and this is what you can get the RQ from here's will sailing at the same time you can see he has a very straight GPS track which of course is why he has such a high RQ so I'm going to turn off the GPS track just for clarity and leave on just the groove analysis lines I have two boats selected here motorcycle and Libra I can click each boat's taxs and compare them with a direct analysis and I can also click the groove analysis lines to get the course speed and vmg for each segment the most important thing to compare is the vmg on this tack the two boats were almost exactly the same but on this tack overall will had a better vmg than Libra and ended up finishing just a bit ahead so I asked will for some tips on sailing up wind in these conditions how exactly does he get his boat to point so high while still maintaining a good boat speed okay so the important part when you're going fast up wind is to just steer as little as possible and I do a lot of steering with the fine trim on the main sheet you know a lot of people they're going for the same feel on the helm and so they steer the boat up and down trying to maintain the same feel but more efficiently is to trim the m in and out just slightly to maintain that feel because the leech tension makes the boat go fast makes the boat point to the point where if you're over sheeted then you have to use the rudder to hold the boat down so you're going for a neutral Helm angle of heel and the boat pointing and use the main trim to accomplish that as much as possible and it looks like in the video you actually have the jib sheo it out a little bit here correct another another feature of this when you're sailing at the top of the number one genua is the in huler is let the clue pretty far outboard that allows us to let the traveler down with a lot of back stay on um and keep some sheet tension on without the main Ling or bubbling and slowing down the flow through the slot yeah had we been on the regular track in board the main would would be washed out when we started looking at the next segment will was really impressed with the geov vid's overlay that we call the compass he wanted me to make sure to mention to you guys that making your own geov vid is really easy all you have to do is run the footage from an action camera like a GoPro upload it onto your computer and the free geovid program takes the date and time stamp from your GoPro video and automatically puts it right in here with your 3D replay check it out at race.com by clicking on geoids this is one of my favorite features of race cues um as you sail along up wind here you can see your relative angle to the Horizon and you can also see your consistency in your angle of heel in your boat speed in your vmg um it draws a DOT every second and remains for 60 so then you can watch yourself all the way through the tack and it's going to start drawing a little cloud of dots the darker one is recent The Faded ones are further away and you can sit there and see just how long it gets it takes you to dial the boat back into that sweet spot and for that little cloud of dots um to tighten up and not be scattered all over next we slowed it down a little so that will could take a closer look at its tack now here's that same tack again on a clickthrough and so I'm watching the procedure as the boat heals over in the it actually doesn't spin out and the boat just heads up smoothly through the tack as the crew weight moves across the boat so this tiller moves once there's minimal Rudder drag and the angle of heal snaps from consistently at one angle on starbo to the same angle on Port without healing over skidding sideways you the main sail goes out while the crew is not on the rail comes right back in when the crew gets to the rail the jib is trimmed in efficiently and everyone just goes right up and hits the rail and you can see that our acceleration out of the tack is very smooth and consistent check out the stats on this tack duration 6 seconds recovery 10 seconds and overall elapse time lost is calculated at 3 seconds it's pretty good but the most interesting part was check out the statistics for the very next tack again here we can watch another Tack and we can watch the tack from Port back to starboard and again all the way through the maneuver um and how long it takes to uh get the dots all tightened up again on your consistent speed in the boat right back up to that steady vmg and then uh it'll spit out the statistics in the top right how slow did you go how long did it take to accelerate and uh it's a near perfect tack as all those numbers match the previous Tack and all of those numbers are are very very good and uh this is a very experienced crew uh my my trimmer Angie Roland has been sailing with me for 15 years and won a couple national championships uh my middle Guy Brian has been sailing with me almost the same amount of time won nationals and so this is a very sharp uh crisp team um to watch through some maneuver I thought the consistency was pretty impressive and then I showed him what the software predicts is basically a perfect tack so uh we're looking through our TXS here and Julia tells me this one is a perfect tack which I was very skeptical of so I'm looking at the video here to see what was different about this tack about why we had such high vmg all the way through the thing and the first thing I saw is looking at the analysis is that our our course getting back up to speed is almost a completely straight line and what I see happen either by accident or purpose in this video is the main is trimmed extra loose to keep the boat on its feet The Traveler is low and the sheet is out so again the boat assumes that perfect angle um and has a very very fast acceleration out of it so we may have given up a little bit of height but the uh the efficiency as shown in the diagram was extremely high getting up to speed out of attack just by not being overheated on the main close us out we found a great example of a pretty serious windshift where the bats that went left really made out over the boats over the right so I asked will to walk us through this last leg and to give us his thoughts on what happened here okay so here is a lured Mark running the last race and um it's pretty windy and there has been a persistent leftand shift uh pretty much the whole rata and the further up the course you go the more the left shift is in so uh Libra actually breaks away at the bottom I think because they were in bad air and goes off to the left hand side so this basically going to put them on the inside of the curve and they're going to gain a bunch of distance on peaches um we elected to go straight on motorcycle just because we were covering peaches and they were closest to us um in scores but the cool thing here is you can watch the Trap track and you can watch all the tracks curve to the left and you can see that Libra being inside on the lifting shift um cut the corner and still a much shorter course because of this so the important part here is when you know the wind is going to go further left up ahead is to be the first one to the left so you're inside of that because every the further left you are the more you're bow up and pointed inside of anyone to your right even though will knew about that left shift he still chose to go right to cover his compens ition I asked him about his decision making process and the importance of sailing smart well this was the last beat of the last race of the rata so the closest boats to us in point in points went right we went right there's no bonus points for winning every race there's only bonus points for beating the other guys you have to good point as always thanks again to the awesome will Paxton and I'd like to invite you to ask your questions to Mr Paxton we're going to be doing a segment ask the salemaker have you been struggling with getting the best sale shape out of your boat do you need some pointers on trim are you just wondering why you're not outpointing the competition send us your question and some photos or even better a video and we might contact you to be featured on that podcast you can send them to me directly it's julia.

Transcript:
[Music] [Music] welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast I'm here with sailing champion and Quantum salemaker will Paxton to discuss the St Francis onesign spring rata which he participated in and it's sounds like it was a great day good to talk to you again will absolutely I'm really looking forward to this this is always the opening event of Summer this is a St Francis spring Keel and there was a pretty good turnout for this race about 80 boats why don't you tell us a bit about the conditions today will uh wind is from the west from the Golden Gate but it's got a lot of southerly in it so there's a lot of left shift tide is a very dominant factor in the race course um as it is washing you straight up in towards a weather Mark you do not want to get on the wrong side of it and it was a pretty strong tied yeah correct it's about a two knot current let's Jump Right In we picked a race where will really had to battle for position so here we are at race one and there's already been a couple of uh General recalls and the E tide is washing everybody over the line which is why it's hard to get a clean start so I finally decided that I was just going to try for a medium start in the middle of the line and not try and win it because the danger of being over early in the E tide um is basically ends the race because they're running very short races because we had no racing the day before so we went four races today um unfortunately I ended up misjudging line when you couldn't see it and just being conservative so I ended up buried in the second row and I had to go on a on a pretty epic mission to dig out of it everybody gets a bad start occasionally or maybe more than occasionally but what was really interesting about this to me is how will fights back after this less than Stellar beginning and moves back up through the fleet in fact he actually goes on to win this rata in the end so here we are shortly after the start and we're buried in we're buried in the second row of a bunch of starboard attackers and so even though I'm in bad air I'm not panicking I'm waiting for a hole to open I'm not trying to force it through or go on too radical a duck I waited for a couple other boats that were in worse spot than us to clear out you know again rule number one is patience Don't Panic um and that enabled us to do a really clean Tack and accelerate out and be in a good spot you really want to avoid having to do a tack and Tack backing see the one boat below us there cleared out then we ducked one boat and came right up on the Wind sheet in at speed and are shooting out into a clear Lane which is what you want to do when you clear out see here they come see we're already down we're sheet in and here we go I'm already coming I'm coming back up to meet them as they go across the front of me I'm not ducking as they go across in front of me I'm coming up as they come across in front of me that's the key so after this duck you and this other boat Libra are heading up wind and Libra's actually ahead of you and you decide to tack long before the lay line uh can you walk me through the thought process for that maneuver in an e tide you always want to attack short of lay line going up wind you know in this case if you're sailing up wind on starboard you want to be sailing for the port tack lay line like almost planning on having a short hitch on Port at the end to ensure you don't end up overto stood and having the tide wash you past the mark in this case we tacked shy the line in clear air and had the best vmg all the way to the weather Mark and you were well ahead but what happened with that tack right at the Mark uh somebody stood on the jib sheet ah he is not perfect like our like our Tack and duck was well planned this one was not well planned because we started it became a Miracle Lift we were almost laying the Mark just right and then it was about 10 boat lengths from the mark or less and I said hey we got to attack twice and so it was not the most planned maneuver and therefore it you know it could have gone well but it did not stuck in a big pile up at the weather Mark rounding will doesn't give up he's still battling for position in the race and thinking ahead all the time okay so this situation is a really classic one in ssco Bay where there's a bunch of boats getting to the weather Mark in a KN because it's ebbing and they're all flush there but as soon as you turn around and point the bow down into the tide you stop and so you have a big crowd of boats all of a sudden and a crowd of boats going downwind is really slow so everyone's got to look to get a clear Lane and get out of that crowd of boats because they all Bunch up we turn down into the tide so here I didn't even let my crew put the pole on the kite initially we did a free flying set because I wanted to JB out immediately but because we had a bad attack and we slowed down Libra overlapped us on the inside and we couldn't Jive and you can see the two boats in front of us are trapped going that way CU they're trying to stay in clear air and they sail out of the wind against the shore and start Jing out and then they sail under our bad air and we all catch up to each other again and this is where we all start jibing and heading out on a reach fighting for Clear air but it's a really classic situation where all the boats round in a knot and come to a stop against the tide and bunch up when you're in a pack of boats downwind and this reaching duel starts a common thing is to hear people yelling proper course proper course which is a rule that isn't very well understood so I ask Will to elaborate proper course is the most efficient um heading to get to the mark proper course is not aiming at the Mark as we all know you have to sail vmg angles or two shifts so some if you're not aiming at the Mark no one can yell at you and say well you're not aiming at the Mark you're not sailing proper course proper course is whatever you think is the fastest way to get there the lured boat has lots of leeway to determ what proper courses is very hard to prove otherwise I mean if you're sailing if you're going downwind for instance and a boat sailed up behind us into lur and then tried to L us to the point our spiners um couldn't fly you would say then for sure that they were Ling you above proper course and have rights to do that so proper course is would then be determined by what is the proper vmg angle to be sailing to the mark not necessarily the heading at the Mark now you know what to say when someone's screaming proper course at you so remember will is still trying to battle his way up through the fleet let's take a look at his next maneuver when he's finally going to get by Libra here we're trying to engineer a pass we're playing chicken with El Ron who is reaching up and reaching up and reaching up and looking for an opportunity to try and pass both of us to weather even though we're the both lead boats are trying to resist going up because we're going out into worse and worse tide and so it's just a big game of chicken and Libra eventually here is going to give up and let us both go by on our silly reaching duel over the top of them so you can see Will has come up behind Libra now and he is getting ready to move in for the kill here right so you can see um we're in a position to pass Libra but we don't really have it sealed yet and I see a set of waves coming so you can see everybody reach down and make a little adjustment just before the wave hits and hiked weather and what we did is we put the bow up and accelerated just as the waves hit and Libra did not compensate for the waves coming so our wind Shadow hit them just when they hit the wave and they came to a stop we went shooting by right over them without having to defend a left from them there they go hitting those waves and their kite collapses boom and we're gone with just just opportunistic timing with the wave coming at us you can see our sails go back out and the pole square up again so remember will battled through this and actually went on to win the whole series and he had some advice for us at the end here yeah I think the the whole trick to this race was right out of hit Checker's guide of the Galaxy which is Don't Panic we kept our heads even after we had a bad start and we waited for an opportunity to develop and we didn't panic at the top when everybody collapsed on us and kept fighting for Clear air and uh to make an opportunity to move forward you don't have to win the riado in the first race that pretty much the strategy is not to try and win the Riata in the first race but still be in it to win it to the end so you're still trying to pretend that it was your strategy not to win all the races no one's buying it my strategy not to lose in the first race uh Peach has sailed a really amazing race here um we tied him in the third race and we only beat him by a boat length going across the Finish Line at the end it was a very tough tight series I like to give will a hard time but he sailed an excellent race in a very competitive Fleet I have to really work hard to find races that he doesn't win so that's why I like to tease him a little bit uh thanks again so much well as always you were awesome and I want to put a call out there to anybody else that might be interested in being featured on our podcast we're specifically looking for Salem makers that want to maybe build their business a little bit professional Sailors just send me an email julia.

Transcript:
[Music] [Music] I'm Julia and welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast today I'm back with Will Paxton a six-time national Express 27 champion and a Quantum salemaker in San Francisco California Hey Juliet good talking to you um I'm here to talk about my favorite midwinter series I've been raising this since I was a junior sailor about 23 years sailing mid winners in the Berkeley Circle and I'd like to share some insights this is race four of a four Monon series and we have a fivepoint lead on the second place boat so what we're looking for here is somewhat of a conservative start we just need to uh beat Ergo or finish within a few boats of them to win the series wind speed here is about 9 to 10 knots true San Francisco Bay is one of those places where winds can shift very rapidly and in this race it turned out that the sailors were able to fetch the Winward mark from either end of the starting line what this means is they did not have to tack at all in order to round the first Winward Mark and they didn't have to Jive in order to get to the lard Mark in a race like this the start is incredibly important it's pretty much the whole race because if you get behind at the start it's going to be really hard to catch catch up will always does his homework and makes sure to leave enough time before every race to sail that first upwind beat because he did that he knew there was a big shift up at the top here a header you don't want to be the upwind boat when you're sailing into a header as everyone gets headed the boats that are further up wind are going to turn down and end up pointing right at those boats to lur and falling behind so taking into account a lot of factors will figured that the winning start was probably somewhere in the middle of the starting line but you see will didn't need to win this race he was five points ahead so he decided to stay out of the battle and just to start all the way at the pin end in clear air on Port Tac and just make a beline for the mark let's see how that worked out for him so here's our starting strategy is that we come in hot on Port and anybody that tries to Lebow us or attack on our face we can blow through with speed so here's that was Athena going by and then Here Comes Ergo the second Place boat in the race they could have leave out us they could have faced us except we were coming in so fast boom we just cut by our Stern right there they could not face us and the issue here because the Mark was laybl on Port every second you spent on starboard was a loss so because we just blew through both those guys that went off to our left uh that was a loss we've already passed them they're done so the only danger here is the winning start was halfway down the line on Port and that's where Wy coyote and and a couple other boats are down there so right now we are wide open reaching traveler Down lead down going as fast as possible because our pre-race start check said that there was a big header at the end so what we're trying to do right now is do the geometry and foot to the header and beat the lower boat sailing a shorter course with speed to the header will got the start that he wanted and was able to get ahead of his main competition Ergo but one boat did get that midline start and get ahead Wy coyote they actually crossed us by two boat Links at the top by virtue of the header and they're a very well sailed very fast boat and we were not able to close that two boat lengths down all the way around the race course although Wy coyote wasn't carrying a tracking device we were able to pick them up on the video feed oh here here it comes right here here's Wy Co winning the race to cross us and this is it this is the race right here this cross everybody to our left was way overstood everybody to our right was closer to the mark than us it struck me as I was watching this how important it was for all the competitors to get out like will is always preaching and sail the Winward leg before the race competitive Sailors everyone knows that's something that you should do so I asked well how many people does he see actually going out and doing this homework before the race only two or three boats actually show up and sail the weather leg and um you know I I grew up sailing as a junior sailor my dad was a coach uh we had some some amazing coaches of the richm Y Club Jr program um one of our best coaches was Mike McQueen and he was a professional motorcycle racer and it was like the most important thing to show up to the course and run the course Before the Race and guess what the meaning is behind the name of Will's boat it that's motorcycle Irene or Mike McQueen motorcycle racer if you didn't show up to the course and run all the jumps and take all the turns Before the Race you at a huge disadvantage from someone who had already done it so if you show up to the race course and you haven't done that first beat and logged some Compass headings you're at a big disadvantage and uh in in this race the entire race was all about the start the angle and the first beat and the rest of it you know was just postcript was very very critical to show up and run the first weather Lake when you can fetch the Winward mark from the starting line there's not going to be a lot of opportunities to create passing LAN in a race like this the start was very important and the boats finished pretty much in the same order that they rounded the first Mark however this was still the final race in the series and with motorcycle Irene in first place in the series and Ergo in second they had to try something to get ahead you can get frustrated in a parade race like this and try and force something to happen and Ergo is a very well sail very fast boat and they were trying to be aggressive and they were basically if you watch motorcycle and Ergo you see exactly what was happening between motorcycle um and Wy coyote as we were trailing behind them about the exact same distance so here you can see Ergo is straight in line and doing the conservative thing so Ergo decides to foot out and try and find a lane around our bad air to lure and this definitely had potential to um to create a passing Lane but you know you can see I flot it back down S I just kept a clamp on that I honored the threat basically when they went to foot they were footing for a header and if they started to gain the cover Move is just a foot with them and it doesn't matter how far you go as long as you keep going fast and maintain the geometry to cover if I get Fifth and he gets six I win if I get 10th and he gets 11th I win never let that guy go we finished up by talking about the exact sail trim settings that will use to get the maximum speed out of his boat in these conditions well this is just a situ it's a situational um occurrence where uh this may happen in a one design race where you are coming in on a Pac lay line um at the top of the course and lifted this happens in the Berkeley Circle a lot and you're overstood so instead of the main washing out what you want to do is blow the lead lead out or let the let the car act um ideally what you want to have is the floating lead which we have in most of the top Express 27s where the lead goes all the way outboard allowing you to put the boom low and the boats go very very fast without the main washing out because you want to keep the slot open between the main and the Gena because you can see if you look up at the draft stripe of the Genoa right there of you can see the camber of the sail and how straight the exit is and and you can see how it matches the exit of the main so there's no drag at all between the two will went on to explain that it's not only important to keep the slot open in these kind of conditions but to also make sure that you're maintaining a neutral Helm so because we were the weather most boat and we had a clean Lane we could go as fast as possible so as fast as possible we had our inboard lead eased almost all the way out you can see the um the reaching block is straight between the clue and the override bar to the winch and that the traveler is down on Center Line and what that does is it makes sure that there is very little load on the helm and the boat can go as fast as possible and how exactly do you find that sweet spot when you're actually out there you ease the man all the way out until the man almost fogs and you pull it back in until the helm goes neutral if you let the main all the way out you'll get Negative Helm and the bowel will drop down if you pull it in too tight the bowel will head up and what you want it to do is be as Loose as possible and fast you do want to have no Rudder drag at all you want the helm to be in the middle of the boat you want the bow to be down and you want the tell tales of the jib to be streaming on both sides I just want to say thank you again so much will for joining us uh thanks Julia I really enjoy sharing my racing insights with you and I look forward to next time well thanks again to Mr will Paxton for an awesome race breakdown I know I learned a lot and I look forward to seeing you next time here on Race to win the sailing podcast if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www . rcu.com podcast

Transcript:
[Music] [Music] I'm Julia and welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast we've done all three races in the San Francisco midwinter series narrated by Champion sailor and Quantum salemaker well paxin the first race there was about 10 to 15 knots of wind the second there was about 5 to 10 knots of wind and now this third race is a Drifter Max win speed two and a half maybe three knots will Paxon again did very well took a bullet in this race so we asked him if he could share some of his secrets for good speed and light air well just two things to say about that and that is to have the crew sit forward and led and so you're going to do two things here one is you're without any pressure in the Sals you're going to use use gravity to keep the camber shape in the sails and this is why I like to design uh daon sails for smaller boats like the express 27 because the the inherent rigidity of the fabric helps the sail hold its camber um and not just hang there limply um the crew weight lur also um buries Ford and lured also buries the bow in the water and the the bow being pushed further underwater increases buoyancy and so it allows the greater surface area of the back of the boat to pick up out of water and reduce drag as well good light air racing is often surrounded by mystery as these fast boats are seeming to ghost by in a special wind that no one else has and so there are a lot of rumors about how these people accomplish this we went over a few of these common tips and tricks for better lighter sanding and ask Will what he thought worked best first off is the boom kicker some people think a boom kicker which helps hold up the boom and increase mainil twist is key to good light air performance but will doesn't sell with one at all um in very light air and we're talking about wind of say four knots and under and four knots would have been windy today it was much lighter than that um it does help to push up on the boom and create more twist um in the main The Twist is very very important in the light areir you're trying to encourage the moving upper air to attach to the sail and move down the sale um I don't have one personally because you know 98% of all the racing we're going to do is going to be in five knots plus and I hate having the weight and also I think that the solid boom kicker is an obstruction to the crew tacking cleanly across the boat so I just don't have one oh also um a trick I've seen if you're in a spot and you're really desperate to get some twist to the main because a lot of Us carry our Spiner pull on the Boom is you can tighten the topping lift and the topping lift can act as a uh improvised Boom Lift if need be another thing Sailors do in light air is instead of using a large sail to catch more wind when it's light they'll switch to a 95% or so jib like a number three the theory being that in light air the airf flow will find it easier to attach to a smaller sail we asked will to elaborate a bit on this Theory uh definitely purpose-built light air sails whether they're spiners or Drifters um are smaller than the maximum possible sale because the smaller sale will fly um better with less pressure like in the express I would almost always keep the Gena um you just got to keep the sail eased way far out um you've got to keep a gap between the two sails to encourage air flow and so that the wind will work in the sail plan and not go around it as if it were in one piece if it were really bumpy water and the Gena was collapsing in yeah I might seriously consider consider the number three um a thing I tried in the race on Sunday that was equally as frustratingly light is I actually ease the Gena heler down about 3 feet um so the foot foot of the sail was actually on the deck and the top of the sail was wide open and there was as much weight as possible off of the leech and we actually got that to work for a while but that's a desperate situation everyone has their own idea of the best tram for their boat in these tricky light air conditions some people like as much camber as possible some people like to get their sails really flat for different reasons now will had great boat speed in this light air so we asked him his thoughts on the variations for light air sail trim um you know rounder sale is more powerful um sail also encourages air to attach to it and flow around it as if it were an air foil better than just a a flat board um the one thing you want to be careful of um you can see in the video my back stays very loose in a lot of and that's because in San Francisco Bay and light air it's protected body like a lake and it is super flat if it were bumpy or bouncy at all I would pull the back stay on just to stop the sails from flapping or shivering in the light air and a little bump sail flaps the air will detach from it um if the boat is really steady and your crew doesn't move and everybody's forward and lured you keep that back stay loose and the sails is round and Powerful as possible so I've selected two boats here Diane and then motorcycle I which is Paxton's boat great Sailors on both boats they start right next to each other sail virtually the same course and in the same body of water but after about 10 minutes which is nothing on a on a 40-minute leg Paxton has managed to create about 150 meters of Separation getting ahead of Diane well the reason that I started up at the pin was because of I just even if I was late there you were going to have clear air the entire way and U our crew does a very very good job of settling into a motionless forward and lured position um with the sails holding steady and everything eased and just taking advantage of every puff possible as one thing that happens in in light air is that the the air wants to move up with the Mast head it doesn't want to come down to the water at all so the weather most boat will see the most wind in your sails and then for possibly four or five boat lengths around the boat the air may move may move vertically over and around the boat and create a much bigger Lee situation um for much further downwind than you would ever feel and say 10 knots of Breeze it might block the wind for 100 yards down wind because there's so little pressure to go down the air just goes up and over um in the path of least resistance around a pack of boats so only the guy on the weather side is going to have pressure and everybody else is going to have nothing to lure it attacking in light wind is tricky to say released so we ask our expert here for some of his tips for surviving this maneuver in these kind of really super light conditions attacking in light air is very expensive so you got to make sure you really really really want to do it um in this case I had seen which way the tide was going and I was afraid that we were if you kept going past the Mark we were're going to get swept down tight of the mark so I was kind of just making a move to set myself up to side of the Mark um and wait and see what the wind did next um you know here this is a full roll tack you know we called the bout all the bow and the mid bow and the midp person are all down below hiking on the lured side to help the boat tip to lured everybody roll tack down below bow person came on the deck help the Gena around and what we want to try and do here is in the light air attack or Jive if you've got a full baton in your sail in in an Express or any boat is kind of let the boat get around and everyone get sorted and settled down don't flail away at the main immediately to pop the bat and you kind of want the boat to settle down first and you want everyone to stop moving as soon as possible so as soon as the sail stop shaking and the boat heals to lured then you can begin accelerating so you just want to get to that settle down position as soon as you can although Will won this race in the end he didn't lead the entire time here you can see the boat make me smile if a good over 200 M ahead of him all the way up the windward leg and around the mark but will manages to just sneak up and kind of destroy him on the downwind leg look at that he sails 10 minutes faster and we can watch him making his move here so he obviously had better boat speed sh sailed a way shorter course and um had a great leg look at that over 280 M ahead how did you do it well you know that the number one rule in a mid Winner's race it's a very very light air and it's unpredictably shifty is Don't Panic um you stick to your guns you don't give up something's going to change um and we did this run as uh as did make me smile um three4 of it without even putting the sper up we kept the same mode that we had going up wi which was forward and lured and just trying to make the Genoa work as an asimetric Spiner almost and carry apparent wind downwind another principle in Midwinter downwind sailing as the boat ahead is not always the best place to be and as the boat behind we could see a wind line coming and so we very slowly inched our way over to get a little building you know three knot puff which felt like a gale um from the from the west and accelerated in it and did a really nice clean set to our Spiner um and uh and carried our Spiner up to make me smile and it was very borderline of of whether the course was too tight to carry the spin sper or if it was going to be too light to carry the Spiner and I think that make me smile um might have initially thought on the weather leg that they were going to set their kite on a port pole um and and fetch the weather Mark so they had their Spiner on the starboard side we had our Spiner on the port side so we were able to pop set close gauge uh while make me smile what hesitated and then ultimately um they slow their boat down a lot when they try to move their Spiner gear around and we got by them in the puff before they got that sorted out well thanks again to Mr will Paxton for an awesome race breakdown I know I learned a lot and I look forward to seeing you next time here on Race to win the sailing podcast if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www.ra.com podcast [Music]

[Music] [Music] I'm Julia and I'd like to welcome you back to the Race to Win Sailing Podcast. We use 3D replays of actual sailboat races to discuss the rules, tactics, and a lot more. Today I have the 2015 Moth World Championships for you in Sarrento, Australia. And we are looking at the final race of the Riotta. Peter Berlin is very favored going into this race. In fact, there's really pretty much nothing he can do to lose at this point. There he is, 23 New Zealand. You can see he steered down very aggressively at the start and has a lot better speed over his closest competitor there, one Australia, Nathan Alred. He is going to maintain that better speed for this entire winward leg. You can see here he has about a 30 meter lead. Here he is tacked over onto port and this tack really gives him a good advantage. He's able to take advantage of several lifts on this leg. You'll see he pulls even further ahead of lifted right now again gaining and playing the chefs. Approaching the mark, he tacks at the lay line right in a knock. So actually overstands a little bit but still manages to make it to the lay line well ahead of Outridge. Here we can see Berlin coming around the winward mark. Outrage will be following right behind him and by the time they both complete the rounding we can see that Berling is a good 300 m ahead. Let's take a look at the upwind stats for this leg. It seems like Berling just out sailed Outrage. faster elapse time, less distance, better average speed, max speed 24.6 versus 21.5. He did have an extra tack over outrage. So, he was just playing the shifts more. Got that better lift and really had a great leg. Josh Mcnight there behind Berlin headed down when Oh, Berlin is down. Oh, no. And here comes Aldridge. He is just going to slingshot right past him as Berlin struggles to get back up again. Okay, Berlin is up 200 meters, 250 meters. Now, Berlin, look at that. She just has great downwind speed. Anytime you see that orange in the GPS track, that's up to 24 knots. And you see the red, that is over 26 knots. Each of those dots in the speed histogram is 1 second. So, you can see the speed and course history over time. Oh no, now is down. Oh, now Berlin's down. They're both down. So, who is going to recover first and get up and get out of here? It looks like Oh, they are both up at almost the same time. Off again and just screaming towards the lured mark. Berlin is ahead going in. He doesn't have a great rounding here. And Outridge is able to just squirt in on the inside and takes the lead again on the second upwind leg. Outrage is going to maintain that lead about 15 meters ahead. As they are approaching the lay line, Berlin goes over, followed by Outridge. Now, Outrage is going to go just past the lay line here, which you can see is this white line coming across the replay. Now, if we take a look here, we can click on the tax to see the tax statistics. Berlin had a pretty good tack, only 3 seconds lost, but Outridge had kind of a little trouble there. Lost 19 seconds on the TAC, and this is going to fall behind Berlin as they approach that mark. Now, Berlin is having to pinch up, is slowing down a little bit to get to the lay line, whereas Aldridge is footing down and is just going like crazy. Let's take a look at the stats for this leg. Check it out. They actually had the exact same elapse time for this leg since they rounded the bottom mark at a different time. Um, but Berlin sailed a little bit less distance and a little bit slower actually where Outrage was going to be presumably higher and faster. Berlin has a much higher max speed of 24.4 and Outridge has 20.8. They both had one tack. So, let's look at this last downwind leg headed into the finish. So Berlin's holding that lead headed down wind stretching it out a little bit. Great speed and he is going to go ahead and J coming up here. Good job. Uh Aldridge chooses not to cover and we can see Aldridge is actually pulling ahead on the favored jer's jer. Lost zero seconds. Um really very impressive. And we can look over at Aldri's job. Let's take a look. Exactly the same thing. lost zero seconds. Amazing. Heading towards the finish line here. Aldridge has pulled ahead on that favored jive. So, Berlin is going to come back over now. He is on the favor jive. They are converging together here. Um, both have great speed. Let's take a look at this in the 3D. As they are converging here, Burling crosses clear ahead. Both of them foiling, just screaming along, and they're headed in. Now, we'll switch back to the top view here. Actric has jibed behind Burling and just lost a ton. Look at that j the colorcoded GPS track tells me that that blue he dropped down to 10 knots just really slow. And I'm afraid that's the nail in the coffin at the end of this race for outridge. There's just not enough water left for him to be able to catch up. And that's it. Peter Berling has finished cementing his win as the 2015 Moth World Champion here in beautiful Sarrento, Australia. Here those guys are presumably chatting after the race. Let's just take a quick look at the overall race stats for here. We have Berlin won by 9 seconds sailing slightly less distance. He had a max speed over the ground of 30 knots and Outrid was just a little bit faster. Actually, one of the things I want to show you too is look at how far it is to the next boat. Um, we've got Chris Rashley just behind them, but he's got another 415 meters before he finishes the race. And then everybody else, you can see them here graphically. Um, it was really an epic race between two great sailors to finish out this competition. And, uh, that's all I have for you guys today. I look forward to seeing you next time here on the Race to Win Sailing Podcast. [Music] If you enjoyed this podcast, you can find more on our website www.racew.com/ podcast.

Transcript:
[Music] [Music] I'm Julia and welcome back to race to win the saline podcast where we use 3D replays of actual races to discuss racing rules tactics and tons more today I have the 2015 moth World Championships in sarento Australia for you I'm showing you the top 20 boats in the gold Fleet here just all kinds of famous names and of course you can access this replay yourself through the moth world's website so on this day conditions were super light this is the first official race of the world's rata where they have the gold Fleet separated out there's only five to six knots of wind now what's interesting about this rata is that the scores from the pre-qualifiers also count so going into this race Peter Burling is very favored he's just really ahead of everyone um now if you're not familiar with the foiling moths it's a foiling dinghy which means the hole can come up all the way out of the rot water really minimizing that water resistance and these boats take full advantage of the apparent wind that we make while sailing so in 5 to six knots of wind they can go 16 knots of boat speed now at first blush that might sound kind of crazy but that's the way the technology is now and the faster that you sail the more apparent wind you generate so it's really key to get up on those foils as soon as possible in order to take off at the pre-art the foiling MS are not foiling they are down in the water uh this is what they call low riding um so they are not able to use so here at the start I've got 23 New Zealand selected which is the we got leader at the moment Peter Berling and then we've also got 39 Great Britain you'll see sailing in here which is Chris Draper uh lunar Rosa Skipper and uh all around just great sailor I'm going to pop out the slide out here and show you the colorcoded key for the GPS tracks so you can see that when we have the purple The Violet that is going to be less than six knots definitely not foiling the next color is that sort of dark blue here and that's six to 10 knots that's the transitionary area where they're sort of popping up and down and then turquoise and up that's 10 knots and above definitely foiling so right from the beginning of the race we have these two very clear leaders Chris Draper and heroki goo and then behind them we have American moth Champion Bora guli his speed is getting up there and it looks like he is up on foil and you're going to see him kind of pop in and out here as he is struggling to break through that barrier and you can see so now he's really headed down and look at that he's got the boat speed up he's caught it so one of the cool things about using the race Q's 3D replay is that we can very easily figure out who is foiling through their tax and who wasn't so I've got keed up the second leg of the race here I've got race leader Chris straper against heroki goo who is in second and doing just really well okay so first let's watch them them both from above we have Chris Draper has completed his T blue dark turquoise going in blue throughout the attack and then recovers very quickly through a turquoise so that is definitely a foiling attack when you see that he stayed above six knots he was able to foil through and now let's look at who Ry goo he is going to come through and uhoh he has dropped into the Violet which means almost for sure he was unable to foil through the tack um actually he had such great tacks that rata I had to really search hard to find one where he dropped down like this but let's take a look at heroki from the front view so here he comes through and you are going to see that speed drops down below below six and he is down he is low riding in the Violet pops up again for a second and then drops down below up again so he's just kind of struggling to recover cover after this tack for whatever reason um and again it's just really easy to see at a glance looking from above which is pretty cool if you want to check it out for yourself you can select different competitors one at a time or by pitting them against each other and simply select the length of their track and you can see the colorcoded speed right here and anything below 6 knots is pretty much definitely not foiling if we wanted to I could turn on the full track and I would be able to analyze all of his taxs for the entire rata at just an easy glance okay so here we are in just those final moments of the last leg of the race we have got Chris Draper in the lead by um over 200 M uh although it looks like heroki goo is sneaking right up on him and then we have right behind them Peter Burling so here all three of them are for you we've got Draper goto and Berling right here all lined up for first second and third looks pretty set you know they're they're really close to the finish line and then some pretty interesting things happen here and look at goto's just got this burst of speed on he is coming down below Chris Draper and closing on him like crazy and here they are lapping other boats now the way that this race Works once one boat finishes anyone remaining on the course does not complete another sausage they just head directly for the finish so here it is it is on for first place in the first official race of the moth World remember their scores from the pre-qualifying days do count as well so here he is making his move he is low and he is fast now if you look down and you see where the finish line is here it becomes obvious that goto it looks like he's going to finish ahead of Draper here huge upset and we can see Draper is making his job now he is stuck in a pack of boats so he had some limited maneuverability there and heroki was able to just sneak right in there look at that now all of a sudden heroki goo is 52 meters ahead of champion Chris Draper and is going to come in and let's see if he's going to do it he is actually going to cross the finish line first after Chris Draper has led this entire race what an upset congratulations to rogi goo let's see what they both had to say about this after the race um yeah I ended up second in that race um a little bit disappointing cuz I was leading by a long way at one point but coming into the bottom you never know what can happen when it's as light as that and I was coming into the lure Mark the last lure Mark and there was a big load of boats all Gaggle together that we were lapping and they just sucked the wind away and hiroi in true samurai Japanese style came around the outside and now just snuck it for me it was a good race oh yeah I can't describe how I feel now is uh like a top of the world never dreamed that it's unreal unreal I was even thinking that to shorten the course shorten the course in the second top M Prett shorten the course second is enough but in the end yeah I won the race much nicer oh yeah now everyone is packing cu no win for race tomorrow we start 11:00 instead of 1 it's going to be big Breeze just relax one now [Music] well that's everything we have for today guys I just want to say a special thank you to all of the sponsors of the moth worlds and especially a thank you to Bo outage productions for allowing us to use their video and uh I'll see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www.rac.com podcast [Music]

Transcript:
[Music] I'm Julia and welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast where we use 3D replays of actual races to discuss tactics rules and More in today's podcast we'll be chatting with Alan tur Hune the winner of the 2013 j22 World Championships as well as 11 other North American championships including the lightning flying Scott and thistle so Alan why don't you tell me a bit about this series that you're racing in and uh about the conditions on this day yep we're it's uh we're really excited to have the the quantum j70 winner series again with Davis is yach club and Tampa uh this was the first event in December which is the first of the three events one in December one in January one in February and uh you know it was a really nice weekend unfortunately we didn't get the sale on Sunday but we had four good races on Saturday and six to 10 knots of Breeze and uh we're really excited to be able to partner with with you guys here at race q's and be able to to have the playback of the races and talk about it and give the people who sailed in the rata just something more to uh learn from and and have fun with so we're really excited about it to kick things off Allan and I jumped right in to talk about his General starting strategies that he uses for each race yeah I mean our Focus all the time is is really what our our game plan is and what side of the course we want to get to and you know picking a favorite side and we really just focus on a general area of the line not a specific spot and just try to find a place where we have space and and have a nice hole and can go you know straight for a while if we want to with speed and not really focus on exact locations but just general areas we found is work really well when I get to talk to professional Sailors like Allan who have won it seems like like everything I always want to find out what's their flight checklist what are the things that they go through in their mind when they're starting every race by the four minute period we've kind of decided what section line we want to start in and and what we're really focusing on in the last you know between two minutes and a minute to go is finding the area in the line where where we think we have enough spacing and then uh hopefully at you know somewhere between a minute 15 in a minute we get on staro Tech and then we're just fully working on how to accelerate and get to where we need to go Alan wasn't super pleased by his start he said he got on starboard a little late but he recovered really well and is actually ahead of spring here who goes on to later win the race he decides to tack to the left and I thought it was kind of an interesting decision and was wondering why he chose to separate from the boat that was just right there with him now were you do you think you were headed back to the left because you thought it was more pressure on the left at that point or you're just trying to you just think you're getting too far out you're just hitting coule things I mean we like we felt like we were finally a little headed and we had a good pressure line to go across I mean it was so Shifty going back and forth puffy streaky we really just felt like our better move was you know I hate using the term layup but kind of just you know get back towards the middle of the course with everybody else and kind of live the fight another day I think we were more worried you know race two of the rata getting really far to one side you know we'd made a good gain and and didn't want to just blow it all up by you know being too risky you know in the end I probably still would have done it again I mean I know hindsight's 20120 and it obviously worked out for them really well but you know I mean I look back and we still had a third in that race and it gave us a higher percentage of doing well so as far as the j70 why do you think it's been so successful um I really think one of the things is just the the setup of the boat and that you know it's a it's a four-person boat there's no weight limit so you don't have to stress out about that and it's really set up well to be able to sail with kids or spouses you know I'm I'm really lucky to sale my wife she goes with me uh a lot of the riatas and there's there's tons of husband wife teams and you can sail with two couples there's teams out there that are you know a full-on family husband wife and kids um you know we've taken our kids out on Thursday nights a few times and and that's that's the beauty of it you don't you don't need four you know super athletes rock stars whatever you want to call it to sail the boat really can be sailed by you know friends and family and that's why I think people are flocking to it it's really good for that I asked Alan if he had any top secret j70 downwind tips and tricks to share with us and here's what he said I think the one thing downwind you know people get a little bit afraid of driving because they think they lose a lot of distance but you know you can do it pretty well and not lose a ton of speed I think the one thing to do is make sure when you go into it that you're not slow going into it if you especially in light air if you're slow going into the Jive it's pretty hard to come out of it going fast if you know what I mean so absolutely I pulled up a couple of Allen's jibes in the replay and if you look at the colorcoded GPS track you can see he's clearly speeding up before each of them yeah I mean anytime we think we're GNA Jive you know if we're talking about it I initially will make sure I put the bow up a degree or two just to give the boat a couple tents of speed so when we go into it the boat has enough Pace to get through it and not slow down too much I clicked on some of the stats for Allen's jbes and this one was particularly impressive he actually gained two seconds on this J I mean that's pretty it's pretty good yeah for six knots of Breeze or 10 knots of Breeze I'll take that any day the week I wanted to get some specifics on Allen's sail trim so I asked him about his main twist and I also wondered if he was trimming his main or was somebody else doing it for him no so I trimed my own main um and the boat in This breeze especially is pretty main sheet sensitive so the lighter it was anytime the guys weren't hiking you I had the traveler all the way up and the boom on Center Line uh but as soon as we felt like the boat was really starting to go and you know we had people even remotely you know leaning up on the rail or even start to put the legs over the side I'd go traveler down a few inches and just trim harder on the main sheet which uh would help you know keep the bow up and also would put some tension on the for stay because the rig was pretty loose so by trimming on the main sheet we could firm the for stay up a little bit by you know just using the leech of the main to tension it up and the bow performed a lot better that way so it gave the about the flexibility to change gears because when it got light I could go traveler up ease the main sheet and the jib would get a little Fuller because the head stay get loose and as soon as we're rumbling it would be traveler down maybe you know four five inches and then trim the main sheet a couple you know two three four five inches depending on how loose it was to really get the the leech of the main firm to help keep the bow up and to you know tighten the for stay a little bit so the main was pretty effective in in that stuff of helping change gears on the last downwind leg Allen gets into a really intense ding duel for second place and he gave us some more tips on downwind speed you know the one thing that I know our tactician Marcus did really well was just focusing on keeping us in lines of Breeze and it really paid and and we jbed in earlier a lot of than other people because I think they were more afraid of getting the bad air from the other boats and just really should have focus more on just getting into where the Puffs were so we did a pretty good job of gaining because of that so and I mean if you look there there's just some stages where we're going at pretty good Clips I mean the speed's pretty high you see the yellow we're going pretty well and there was a bunch of yellows in there so absolutely staying in the Puffs downward is even more important because there aren't as many of them because you're going with the breeze you're kind of following a puff for a long time versus upwind where you're kind of passing so there's more Puffs but there's shorter duration uh so if you miss one up wind it's it's kind of a you know we'll get the next one next time whereas downwind if you miss one it's a long painful process because you're kind of going with the breeze it's kind of both you going in the same direction so to close things out Allan and I talked a bit about common mistakes he sees on j7s that he thinks really affect racing performance any other tips you think that you could say about the j70 that like a j70 Sailer might say oh god I've always wanted to know that or I never I I mean the one thing that we I I always tell especially this light air is really be aware of the jib sheet because um you know when it gets light it it tends it can get over tried pretty quickly and as soon as the puff comes and the sail you know gets loaded up it can be under trimmed pretty quickly so mean I know Marcus was moving our jib sheet all the time and just keeping the thing trying to keep it at optimal trim and when the conditions are changing like that it's just constant adjustment so you know any boat that was out there that had their jib just kind of trimmed to the mark and cleated probably didn't do very well and they were struggling up wi and a lot of it was just you know the jib is the gas pedal and if you adjust it and keep it going the boat performed a thousand times better so that's all that we have for today on this podcast Alan I just want to say thanks again so much for your time and remember that app is free you can get it at race.com and I'll see you next [Music] time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our

Transcript:
I'm Julia and welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast where we use 3d replays of actual races to discuss tactics rules and more today we're back with will Paxton a six-time national champion and a sail maker for quantum sails this is a very light air day in San Francisco with the very talented expressed 27 fleet will tell me here we are at the pre-start what what are you thinking about during this time well the pre-start is in multiple phases and the first thing is showing up to the start line and doing your homework which means doing the first weather leg watching the compass and trying to figure out what the what the base compass angle is and what the ships are doing where the puffs are coming from and then in the mouth 10 minutes before the start we spend some time circling and watching the fleet's in front of us start and watching how they're affected by the shifts how the boats in the right are doing how the boats are left are doing what we saw in this case was the boats on the right we're getting the right puffs first and lifting higher and the boats on the left were we're getting into the left breeze on the other side of Brooks Island ensuring to the left the danger of being too far left even though the pin was favoured was sailing in a header on starboard not laying the mark and then sailing a header back on port to the weather mark which would be a big loss so we selected a safe starting spot where we were gonna have a big lane about a third of the way down from the boat our goal just go as fast as fast as possible and not get tangled up with anybody so now we have one minute to the start you've got your pre start maneuvering going on here and when that gun goes off the boats around you have about two and a half to three knots of boat speed however at the gun you have four and a half knots of speed and only four or five knots of wind can you tell me about that a little bit our our goal here again starting on a fetching leg was to be going as fast as possible because you know ideally you wouldn't have to tack and you want to avoid tangling with other boat so I made sure we had a big clean Lane and that we were close to the line at the gun going as fast as possible it's more important here to be going fast than it was to be dead on the line so we were going very very fast at the start my only danger here was Abigail - lured so I made sure that in every puff we footed we made sure the boat never got too flat the crew works their crew weight very very hard here - not them not let the boat stand up to straight it's very important Express 27 to keep a little bit of heel on because that's your power reserve to make sure you never slow down so the crew work ler weight in and out constantly with every puff and we ground along and made sure that we maintained our bow over Abigail Morgan as they were the only boat that could have gotten in our way and slowed us down and let other boats advance on us you really had a great start you were first to the windward mark by quite a bit but I want to take a look at two other great sailors at the mark ere go and kill a mockingbird now one of those boats started at the committee boat and one started right in the middle of the line but the outcomes were totally different one vote over stood the mark and the other one had attacked to make the mark so can you explain the concept of wind shear sailing on San Francisco Bay were used to sailing around islands and usually we're sailing around Alcatraz or say Angel Island where there's corners and ships we know well in this case we're sailing as we only would the mid winners in the lis of Brooks Island so what we saw on the start is the wind to the right of the island was from the right and the wind to the left the island was the left but that the weather mark the important thing to determine here is what wind is the weather mark in and sail and that wind as enticing as the other wind looks so what we did is we made sure that we sailed in the right hand shear but knowing that there might be a header to the left in the middle I actually thought that we were going to end up tacking in the middle of this beat but instead the right came through and you know we basically got lucky and laid it but the guys on the left who were punched out - lured had the unfortunate sailing in a bit of a header and then tacking and sailing in a header again to the weather mark and the rough thing here to understand is the guys to the right all over stood because they were in a pack they could have actually put the bow down and footed and possibly beat us to the weather Merck and the lured guys the way they could have gotten out of this is to decide where the max header was and just have tact then and gotten to the right let's take a look at the numbers on this downwind leg so we've got you matched up against another pro sailor here on the boat Urgo and you really did well on this leg you gained about a minute on him it looks like you managed to sail a shorter course and had better boat speed which is pretty phenomenal considering you're in a pro competition here it's kind of a neat trick because normally sailing downwind we all know if you sail lower you go slower and if you sail higher you go faster so tell me how did you manage that boat speed how did you manage to sell lower and faster especially against another Pro again this one of those important parts of boat speed is the crew weight so we're very very careful - especially in light air where you're below full power we'll take the biggest person on the boat and have them sit down below and forward and balance their weight down there so the crew on the deck can move around easily without disturbing the sails you know again here it's key to be able to shoot your sails so the twist matches both of them you know in this kind of vmg conditions we've got the the twin off the main is shaded in the van is eased the upper leech is open tactically on this run most of the race course was in the easterly side of the breeze and as we went down the course that obviously the shortest course was leaving the line to port as you can see in this picture however the wind got light and lifted and the safe thing to do is put the bow up and stay in the easterly breeze on the east side of the course and go fast and stay between everyone in the market very very important and light shifty conditions keep yourself positioned between yourself and the opponent so here we are on the second upwind leg where once again you've just made huge gains on everybody tell us about your thinking process on your tactics on this leg well the most important thing to do before you start the beat is look upwind before you even round the lured mark to go upwind and see if you can see and you other race boats cruising boats anything going on that shows you what the shift is going to be doing in this case we saw a left trend coming and in a classic you know tactical covering move with the left shift coming we took a step up and basically you take a step up until the next boat comes around the mark and you tack back and that puts yourself upwind between the other boat and the mark and doesn't allow anyone to get any leverage on you and in this case we did see a shift coming and we were correct so you can watch us versus peaches and you can see that we were inside the lift on the way upwind here we have Peugeot and peaches approaching that last lured mark peaches is just right behind you in second place could you comment on the tactics here right there's a there's another boat which unfortunately not shown here which is shenanigans a very very well sail boat peaches is probably covering shanigan tsar between peaches and agro and so you have a tough decision here you want to go straight you're going towards the dominant side of the course which by the last beat everybody knows is the right side of the course shenanigans tacks and so peaches has a tough decision to cover ago who is second place in the series or shenanigans which is a you know top boat in all of the races that they go to peaches chooses to cover shenanigans an Ergo gets sprung clean to go to the right side of the course the only you can do in this case is to have confidence in your tactics in the history of the race possibly you would stay in the ship to the right and cover the other boat but it's a very very tough decision this is part of the thing that we all live for and sailboat racing is what do you do on that last beat when you're trying to protect your lead or pick off one more boat and I think that this display on race cues it's a fantastic display of that ergo was behind peaches peaches sailed tea tax against the header to cover the other boat and that was 200 meters mm-hmm really really fascinating display and there's a lot to be learned from that and also you can see then as the header continues to go right or goes lead is going to continue to gain okay well this is a light wind day and it's super shifty which is makes those tacks really difficult but you really seem to have it down you do a great job of really not losing too much on these lighter attacks which obviously is really gonna help your overall performance I'm going to turn on this little overlay that'll show your tacking pattern here can you walk me through this tack again you know it's important to express 27 because the rudder is so big to spend the least amount of time with a rudder not going straight so again keeping a lured heel and light air is really important even up winds the big guy is down below forward and lures and as we go into the tack I'll tell everybody how the crew is to move together first okay I want everyone to move to the right side of the boat for an attack on the ports the boat will heal and turn and actually accelerate as a sail plan moves to whether through the turn and even my own body weight as the driver I will stay the lured side all the way through the turn so the boat turns as effortlessly as possible until the sails fall over on the new side and snap full before gently moving back to the weather side and you have to make it a coordinated maneuver I say three two one everybody right side now and we turn and the weight and everybody moves in a coordinated manner and that's the best way to have a good tacking later well thanks again well for all your expertise and for joining us on the podcast today I really learned a lot is there anything that you would like to say maybe just to close us out today so all in all this was a really interesting day of very movable wind ships where he had to be agile you had to have your crew on point you know again at the start really really important to be going fast especially on a fetching leg is something that we only do in the mid winters and that's why I really enjoy the mid wares is so different than our regular summer sailing I thought everybody sailed their boat really hard and it was just really fascinating fun day I'm glad to be out there to be part of it well thanks again well we hope to talk to you again soon and we'll see you next time if enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website WWH use calm slash podcast or search for race cues on iTunes and click Subscribe

setting up a Riata is as simple as dropping a starting line and a couple of marks to change this 3D replay from just a bunch of boats sailing around to a race you need to set up the Riata to identify your Fleet and to access the race cues analytics the first step is to enter the proper name of the Riata it's important that you use the name in the sailing instructions because these race cues replays are crowdsourced just like Wikipedia crowd sourcing is is when someone creates something on the Internet and other people can use it and change it as they need to so don't be surprised if you open up your replay and someone's already set it up for you to Define your Fleet you should create some divisions you can also choose the closest Avatar available if you don't see your exact boat here the first 35s had their start at 1445 so I need to create a start Finish Line in this case and it will appear in your replay like it says just drag and drop the start line or click to edit it's important to make the starting line wide enough that all of the boats in the division or Fleet cross the line if they don't cross the line for example they sail around the outside they're not going to be included in your Fleet rankings or in the analytics once I drop the starting line You'll see that it shows up here in the timeline right at 144 45 now I want to drop a mark So what I'm going to do is zoom out and then head to the point in the timeline where I can see they went around the Winward Mark you want to make sure that you have your track turned on your GPS track which is here I make sure that it's on full track and that way I can see where all the boats went it's pretty obvious where to put the mark it was a single Mark so we can edit it by clicking on it and then we can simply drag it to the proper location which is just about here now this was automatically added to our race course but if it wasn't you can add it just by clicking this Arrow I like to watch everyone sail around the windward Mark just to make sure that I have it in the right place and it looks like I've done that right so now I'm going to move down to the next Mark you can see that the boats went through a gate so I just go back to create Mark and I can drop my gate right there again it's easier to navigate if you give the marks a name I'm just going to drag it to where I can see they went around and that's been added to my route and also shows up on the timeline here next it looks like everybody went back up and around the Winward Mark I already have the Winward Mark entered so all I need to do is to add it to my route and then we went across the start Finish Line and completed the race there's lots of other things to learn about like how to use the fleet rankings how to use the analytics here here and how to create separate divisions and multiple starts but for that you'll need to watch the next videos in our tutorial series happy sailing

Transcript:
[Music] welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast where we use 3D replays of actual races to discuss tactics rules and more hey guys I'm Julia and today we are talking with six-time national champion will p about s trim will is also a salemaker and designer for the quantum Loft in San Francisco also known as Quantum Pacific so we are super excited to be talking to Will and analyzing this race which is a onesign race on board his Express 27 in San Francisco Bay in light to moderate conditions which is really odd for San Francisco Bay in November and this is a geovid which is action camera footage time synced with the 3D replay and sailing analytics there on the right hand side if you aren't familiar with the express 27 it's an ultra light displacement boat designed by Carl Shoemaker and first launched in 1981 these iconic boats are still very actively sailed today so welcome to the podcast will um as I'm sure you know everybody always wants to talk to the Salem makers and designers about Sal trim so let's start with upwind talk to me about your general upwind trim for the express 27 in these kind of conditions well it depends what you're trying to do you early in the race you'll see in traffic The Traveler is closer to Center Line um so we can sheet harder and when you sheet harder especially in the express 27 that equals headstay tension you ever notice if you're sailing up wind like this as soon as you ease the main sheet the head stay sags off which makes the general will get rounder and round up into the main so there's a very careful balance in again not dragging Rudder and you want to be able to pull the leech of the sail tight to make the boat Point um but not slow the boat down so it's important to have a sail that's powerful down low and twisty up top and on our boo you can see we have a floating lead so we can pull the clue of the Genoa inboard of where the standard track is so both of the bottom of the Sails are are very flat and sheeted tight and on both of them you would find the top of the sail Twisted open to maintain flow so you don't stall so here's another upwind situation you're just about to go around this lured mark and you are going to be totally gassed by uh another great sailor Nick on Shenanigans and even though you're being gas you managed to sail through his bad air and right on by how did you do that well nick uh came the midwinters with uh crew of three including himself and uh I knew that the breeze would increase up wind in the in the Gena we had more riding moment than him and um you know it was my judgment here that the right side of the course was heavily favored for pressure and Shi shft you really wanted to go right so tacking for Clear air was the wrong move um so we because we had more weight than him we should be able to go faster so I decided to make a move and foot through him so that totally makes sense you decide that it's a better move to just punch through the gas underneath so let's take a look at the top view here and we can see your track and if you can just comment on that footing through the bad air well it's important when you decide to foot through someone usually the the standard move at aured Mark rounding is to attack for a clear Lane but when the right side is heavily favored um sometimes it's better to foot for a lane instead and so it's important when you foot for a lane that you don't um don't do it gently make a radical moveing can see here we turned down 30 something degrees and went fast and you don't put your bow up again until you're in totally clear air if you if you go slowly looking for the clear Lane you'll go backwards which will make it make it more expensive um distance-wise to get to clear air so basically you would make a 30 to 45 degree move sometimes foot very aggressively for Clear air before you put your vowel back up if that's what you're going to do commit to it well it sure looked like that technique worked for you guys let's look at another piece of your upwind leg here you're just approaching the mark and your crew is doing a great job of just hiking out like crazy and then all of a sudden your jib trimmer comes in and makes an adjustment so what's that about well at this point um you we were back back of the lead pack in the race and someone had tacked in our wind and had they not been there we probably would have laid and so I was trying to figure out what the least worst things to do if we could pinch up and make the Mark um or attack twice which was the less preferable option so I had her come in trim into full point which is full point is Gena touching the top spreader um and I sailed with that briefly and I determined that we weren't going to make it or it was going to be too painful to make it Sail high and slow that way so then after this we opted to tack twice to get clear a so here you are headed into the finish and you're ahead of everybody the nearest boat is about a minute behind you and I was just we were looking at your traveler position your traveler is much farther up than it was earlier in the race in fact it starts out in the middle and just sort of gets higher and higher as things go on but the video shows the Boom is still pretty much at Center Line so you're letting out the main sheet and there's some definitely some twist there so talk to me about that well it definitely the the Northerly Breeze gets lighter into the afternoon for sure but another thing that happens is when the the pack kind of breaks up and you find yourself sailing alone basically a boat Sailing by itself goes faster than a boat sailing in a pack so in this case it's a little lighter but I still want to point but the sheets are a little more eased for more speed um because I don't have to pinch for fear of somebody getting in my Lane so the traveler is up so again I have some weather Helm pushing the bow up but the the sheet is more ease there's probably more twist in this picture than there would have been when I'm trying to point harder and going higher and slower because I can go faster I have room to go fast um I'm comfortably in my Lane I know what shift I'm heading towards and I'm going fast pursuing my strategy if I were if I wanted to point more here the traveler would be down four or five Ines and both sails would be sheeted tire tighter I would be pointing higher and going slower just tactically awesome so let's go back a bit and talk about earlier in the race some of your downwind Technique so at this stage in the race you're approaching the mark and you are behind a pack of pretty good boats and you're going to go around this Mark and in this one run you're going to pass everybody except for one boat passing four or five boats just at once so how' you do that well as on the the weather leg we tried to get to the right right which is the east side of the course because the Puffs and the shift was to the right which unfortunately was the only time in the race that that did not hold true so on the Run um we stuck to our guns and we tried to be the first boat to Jive to get inside on the pressure and the header um and betting on the the pack of five boats and Lead right in front of us would all stick together and slow each other down which is what happened makes sense so talk to me about your Spiner Trim in the video here well it's very interesting in this video I've never seen a a perspective like this but I'm noticing a lot how the um main sheet on the we're running we're squared back and the main sheet and the Spiner sheet are deflecting each other um and in more wind we definitely pull the lure twing down just for stability and Spiner trim but it looks like we should have pulled the twing down a little sooner here because I don't like how the uh the weight of the main sheet over the sper sheet is going to cause some uh some loss and power there so I would change that for sure and also I see the boat is healed lured slightly or flat which means to me it's pretty light running conditions if it was a little windier we would heal weather a little lighter we'd be healed to lured so here you are cruising down wind healing about 0 to 5 degrees to Windward looking pretty good looks like you're barely moving the tiller at all just cruising along you mentioned a little earlier in our talk that you have a crew member that goes down below downwind and then you tell this person to shift around various places to balance the boow down wind which I think is really interesting um why don't you tell us some more about your downwind techniques right well so the the weather heel basically makes the boat want to track lured so you're always really aggressively moving the crew weight around so the boat wants to go straight with minimal amount of tiller movement right rudder rudder movement is drag and detracts from boat speed so in this case we've succeeded in being inside so we get the Puffs first we get the headers first and we are trying to close a Distance on the boats bow out to lure of us by sailing down across their bow in the Puffs which is why we're healed to weather well unfortunately that's all the time we have for today uh we really want to thank will Paxton and his excellent crew for all of their help in creating this podcast and we're hoping to hear from will in the future so stay

to I'm Julia and welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast where we use 3d replays of actual races to discuss tactics rules and more this is our 25th podcast yay today we're going to be looking at a race in beautiful Port Townsend Washington which is a great little Victorian seaport if you've ever been up in that part of the world it's it's just a hop skip and a jump from my hometown of Seattle Washington and Jim human Jim I hope I'm pronouncing your last name right has kindly agreed to talk to us the focus of today is how important it is to play those wind shifts and what a difference it can make in even a really short race so hey Jim and thanks so much for talking to me today maybe you can tell us a little bit about what the conditions were like for this race well on this race it was the last one of our last two races of our fall series and so there were only about six boats out in this race and the two here that we see are Thunderbirds so we actually have a pretty big or growing Thunderbird fleet in port towns and there were four out on this day only two that were recording those Thunderbirds or t-birds are really cool wooden boats if you're not familiar with them um you should look them up there's quite a fleet in the Pacific Northwest so Jim tell us what's happening here in this leg of the first race that we're looking at so little way ahead here right we're like 300 meters ahead and we stopped paying attention to Boreas and you know there's this there's another boat behind us and we're just saying okay we got to cover them they're a good boat we happen to be ahead and Boreas takes off on the right they sea wind to the right that we weren't paying attention because Boris was so far behind us that we didn't think they were even in the race and you'll see they come back and they beat us even though we're 300 meters ahead here they beat us by 150 meters yeah that's pretty crazy that was kinda a big loss there now do you think maybe there was looks to me looking at the replay I can see some sort of some dips in your truck and it looks like there might have been some wind shifts that you missed there was a header that we didn't tack on because we are covering this other boat because we weren't worrying about Boris because we thought we're so far ahead that there's no way that could catch up I think if you tacked there things could have gone a lot differently for you right yeah I agree well you got him back on the second race so let's go look at that one so this is the race that I originally picked out for the podcast and Jim was kind enough to point out the contrast with the first race and how they had missed these wind shifts the first time but then by playing them the second time they were able to stay ahead of Boreas and so here they are at the start going down they're going to stay about 30 or 40 meters apart through this whole thing I have it in hyper speed just so you can sort of get a sense of what has happened in the race before we get to the pivotal moment Boris is catching up a little bit here but you can see that TAC didn't go very well and it gets really shifty right here I can tell that by looking at the changes in the tracks here these guys are good sailors so I know that they're just not driving crazily they're getting lifted and knocked here as you can see it definitely seems like things are going a bit better for you this race Jim why do you think that is so on this race we were making a real effort to try to tack on these matters we've had a history of just sort of not doing that enough and so we've been trying to do it more try not to go all the way out to the ley line and then getting stuck out there let's actually watch you do that here big knock look at that that's a big knock and at this point this is where things are going to get interesting now remember in the last race boys did really well by taking this flyer out to the right-hand side where there's a lot more wind yep and they're probably thinking well we're behind anyways at this point we don't just want to keep following them we're going to go over here where we there's more win now if the tuna on the other hand is going to stick with what's working well for them which is going up the middle and playing these shifts so you can see right here they were getting lifted they get this huge knock and they tack right on it whereas Boreas is riding out by the way did you know that you can click on these trajectory lines right here and for each segment get your course speed and VMG oh no I didn't know that Wow just because it makes it a little easier to see I'm going to turn off the tracks for a second so as you can see is they're both approaching the mark the vmg for Boreas is 2.5 even though their speed is 4.5 whereas since the tuna is getting right where they're going from playing those shifts their speed and vmg is exactly the same which is why once they go around the mark the tuna ends up being a hundred and fifty-five meters ahead of Boreas so let's just take a quick look at the overall picture here of this leg by taking it click on the vs. button here yeah I'd forgotten about this feature I'm glad you did this there's so much in here that you just forget ok so we went 9 9 and they went 1.2 miles and they went faster I love this tool and so even though they sailed about five percent faster you guys sailed about eight percent less distance just with geometry you were going the right way yeah that is that's true so I hope that this shows everybody how important even a slight wind shift can be in the overall scheme of things and I just want to really thank Jim for taking the time to talk to me today and I can't wait to interview some more you guys about what you're doing out there so that we can all learn and sail smarter see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website w wrff comm slash podcast or search for race cues on iTunes and

[Music] I'm Julia and welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast where we use 3D replays of actual races to discuss sailing tactics the rules and lots more one of the first things you learn about how to race a sailboat is that you should be coming up in the Puffs to get a little extra traction upwind and then down in the luls to maintain good speed to get the most out of your boat sailing upwind it's a little more complex than just pushing the tiller coming up in the Puffs and steering down in the luls you need to practice something called changing gears so what is that changing gears it's an analogy that some of you might have heard before so just like in a car you have some choices to make when sailing about power versus speed you pick the gear you need in a sailboat not by shifting with a stick but by changing your wind angle also known as the angle of attack this is the angle between the center line of your boat and the apparent wind so basically you're sailing along in the groove and you're going to change gears by making tiny adjustments to your sails and your heading in a very calculated way to accomplish different goals like maximizing your vmg or maximizing your pointing to get further up wind so first is first gear this is what you're going to use in light air uh maybe it's a bit choppy or mostly it's going to be your maximum acceleration gear when you're just coming off the starting line or you need a lot of power to accelerate in first gear you're going to be pressing the jib which means you're bearing off the wind far enough that both your Windward and lure tell toils are flowing straight out if either one is lifting you're sailing too high or too low when you're close to full speed but you still need to accelerate you're going to be in footing mode which is second gear in second gear you should see the windward tels lifting just a little bit but you should not see the jib luffing at all third gear is what I like to call in the groove this is where you're going for best speed and the maximum available vmg it's your cruising speed this is where most people are about 50 to 60% of the time in this gear you should see that Windward Tel lifting quite a bit really chattering about 45° and you might even see the front of the jib Ling just a little bit The Secret of this chattering gear or third gear is that you have to let out the main sheet to the point where the top Telltale on the main is fully flying always visible streaming letting out the main a little bit increases the twist just a tiny bit which gives you a little bit more power but less pointing ability the next gear is the pointing gear fourth gear which is when you're trying to take a bite out of that Windward position you're snailing a little bit higher than you probably should be you're either Feathering up in a puff or you're pinching uh the only difference is if you're in you're doing it on purpose if you're pinching it's on accident and then fifth gear this is a rare gear it's very slow this is when you're Ling the front of the jib back winding it it's only used when you need to get really really high so that's it gears 1 through five now what's the point of all this we never sail in just one gear for the entire time you should be shifting gears about every 10 seconds so let's imagine you're riding a bike and you see a big hill coming up what are you going to do you're going to downshift your gears before you get there to give you that extra power you need to get up that hill however if you wait too long and you try to shift gears on the hill it's too late you've missed your opportunity to accelerate and to get into that right gear it's the exact same thing when you're changing gears on a saleboat you have to anticipate the wind shifts and shift gears about half a boat length or about 3 to 4 seconds before the windshift so get out there and practice changing gears in a beer can or local race environment learn how to read the Puffs and the luls or find somebody who can and then learn how to shift gears and then learn how to shift gears in the Puffs and the luls come up in the Puffs shifting gears up come down in the luls shifting gears down I am really looking forward to talking more about this topic and how this whole shifting gears thing can totally change your Winward performance but I think that's enough for one day so I'll see you next [Music] time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www.rac.com podcast or search for race cues on iTunes and click subscribe

Title: 23- Tactical Weapons: The Lee Bow

Transcript:
[Music] I'm Julia and welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast where we use 3D replays of actual races to discuss tactics rules and more successful Sailors have a lot of weapons in their tactical Arsenal that they're going to use when they're battling it out with their competition today I'm going to go over one of those more advanced weapons which is the Lee bow maneuver if you take a look at our wind Shadow graphic here you can see this large area which indicates the wind Shadow and then this smaller area near the bow which is the Lee bow zone so if a boat gets into this Lee bow Zone here they're going to have the advantage basically it's just another area of disturbed air created when you're sailing if you can get close enough to someone to Le bow them and get into this Zone the wind coming over your sails and your wake both affect that boat it's going to slow them down and they're slowly going to start to fall back and you're going to appear to escape from underneath them so here you can see in this graphic the wind sort of bends off of your sails and it just really creates more Disturbed air in order for this to work you need to tack extremely close to the person that you're Lee bowing and you need to be almost completely clear ahead the farther ahead and closer you are the faster this will work to sort of flush away the competition if you're considering Lee bowing someone in a Crossing situation you should first look at your relative positions if you're not going to cross clear ahead you're going to struggle to be far enough ahead of the boat when you tack so if you coming across right at midships by the time you complete your tack you're going to be behind them and you're just going to get blanketed and run over so if your only option is to duck you're going to be too far behind you need to just duck if it looks like you can cross clear ahead that's when you can think about that Lee bow we'll take a look at the top view you can see both boats closing 36 is on Port T Boat one is on starbor T and look just how far ahead they are 8 m um but they are going to attack almost right when they would be Crossing and end up just underneath boat one and now you can see they are he is well in the other boats Lee bow Zone which is again this green circle we'll zoom in a little bit so that you can get a better look so they lost 6 m in that tack remember they were 8 MERS ahead so think about that you need to be pretty far ahead and able to get into this position and this is classic Lebow position Le bowing someone isn't going to provide instant gratification it's important once you get in that position not to pinch you need to keep up your speed in order to start flushing them back look there he goes falling back a little bit here comes somebody else he's just not going to get involved in this whole mess whoosh he's going to duck them and go on by and it looks like our guys probably starting to get sick of this it's been about a minute now and he's really starting to feel those effects he's slowing down and he is going to be forced to attack away Lee bowing can be something you want to do depending on your overall tactical strategy you need to keep the big picture in mind so this guy is on Port tack here and we're having a crashing situation with boat 26 he is able to cross clear ahead but he sees an opportunity to take the Lee bow so he is going to flop over onto Port Tac again look how far ahead he is and he does a pretty good Tack and now he is right in that Lee bow zone of boat 26 and he is going to be able to just wash that guy away um remember always keep the big picture in mind it may not be to your advantage to Le B somebody because it is a risky maneuver in this case he's got him right where he wants him and we'll just jump forward a bit here you can see he's starting to slow down starting to fall behind remember it takes about a minute for this to work so it's important not to pinch while this is happening and slow yourself down just be patient eventually the other boat is going to feel the effects and take his leave of you now this is a really interesting example of how to use a Lee bow maneuver to sort of clear the path at the start as you will so this is the green starting box here in the 3 3D replay and you can see the starting line out in front where the water changes color back to Blue and you can see the Pacer line creeping up here behind when that Pacer line gets to the starting line it'll be time to start now we're looking at boats 8 and 21 they're all a little bit early as you can see so they're sort of stopping here at the starting line going really quite slow now so here we are just a few seconds before the start and eight is going to come down and use that burst of speed to get up there on 21's hip and just trap her right in that Lee bow position for a start in clear air it was probably really her only choice and by doing that that she basically created a lane for herself and although they're quite close together right now boom they just started um you can see 21 is just falling behind and falling behind it did not take long for that leeba with that burst of speed and how close eight was able to get to just eat up 21 and she's just sitting there now she's just being gassed in the dirty air and has no no choice but to tack away so remember if you're going to Le bow somebody make sure that you can make it don't try to Le bow someone if you're not going to be able to cross clear ahead if someone Le bows you really the only defense is to tack away if it looks like they're not doing it right you can try sailing down a little bit get up some speed and you won't lose that much if you then need to use that speed to tack away but don't just sit there and let them gas you you are being Le bowed and you need to get out of there and maybe most importantly when you do manage to sort of roll someone from underneath with this lebout tactic try to keep that smirk off your face because you might be next see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www.rac.com podcast or search for race cues on iTunes and click

Title: 22- Wind Shadow and Covering

Channel: Race To Win Sailing Podcast

Transcript:
[Music] I'm Julia and welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast today we have some pretty exciting new tech to show you in our 3D replays we've added wind Shadow functionality to the Race's interface and you get it by selecting it right here in the settings menu so let's start out with the basics a wind Shadow or dirty air is just the Disturbed air that your boat creates as it's sailing we showed two main areas of dirty air in our interface the large Circle here is the wind Shadow also called wind wash dirty wind dirty air and the small one is the Le bow Zone if you don't know what Lee bowing is we're going to be going over that in our next podcast but today we're going to be focusing on the bigger shape this dirty air zone there are a couple of important Advanced things to note about this feature before we go any further first of all it's projecting the shadow in line with the apparent wind angle not the true wind angle so this is important especially when you're looking at it for downwind also as the wind blows harder in real life your wind Shadow actually becomes smaller so as your boat goes faster in the replay the software will shrink your wind Shadow size assuming that you're going faster because there's more wind this is a sailboat right so the point of all this is you want to try not to be in your competitor's windshadow unless you're trying to Le bow them if you are in someone's windshadow it's best to Jive or tack away even if it takes two quick tax as long as your taxs aren't terrible you're going to lose more being stuck in that wind Shadow than if you take those clearing tacks over time so let's take a look at a few examples of how the wind Shadow comes into effect when sailing the first and most obvious thing is covering there you can cover someone or someone can be covering you and there are two types of covering loose and tight a loose cover is when you're protecting your position by keeping your boat between your competition and something like a mark but you aren't close enough to actually be gassing them with your wind Shadow You cover by tacking or jibing with them so that you have pretty much the same wind the point here is to keep them from passing you by catching a puff or a favorable wind shift that you don't get the other kind of cover is a tight cover and that's when you're deliberately G passing someone who has no chance to escape forcing them to tack away and if you want to keep that close cover you're going to tack again on top of them but unless you're in match racing it's generally not a good idea to get into these tacking du unless you're very close to the Finish or rounding a mark which brings us to a point when should you cover so if you're just about to finish and you aren't going to catch the boats ahead of you and the boats behind you are too far behind to catch up you should probably cover the guy that's right behind you to make sure that he doesn't get a puff that you don't get and get you right at the line nobody likes that another idea is if it's a series of races and maybe you're getting near the end of the series and there's just one boat that you're really competing against they're the one that's going to really affect your performance when you sit there and do the math so you might want to cover that guy but be aware and take into account what's going to happen if it means losing other boats in the fleet let's watch what India does as she gets sucked into Mike's windsh out here she was behind kind of late to the start and now is um trying to pass but falling into the shadow now you have some choices here right you can tack away or try to sail under and through what doesn't work is trying to point higher pretty much ever so she is actually going to drive down here and drive right through the windshadow so we see now she's about 18 meters behind and she's getting that speed from driving down allowing her to punch through that dirty air is coming out the other side and is now passing Mike and is going to pull ahead this is a great example of what to do and she didn't hesitate they didn't sit there wondering oh what should we do where should we go they just steered right down rolled right underneath and now are clear ahead so great example of what to do and look at that now India is gassing Mike and is even just really pulling ahead and leaving him in the dust let's take a look at Julie Julet and India here right after the start Juliet is actually ahead of India um but India is coming along and it's just going to roll right over the top now Juliet had the opportunity here to come up and get into the Lee bow position on India which is that green circle right there and you know hold the lead but instead she's going to miss quite a few Puffs now you can tell there's a puff because whoosh see that right there see how small the wind Shadow is on India here that indicates a sudden burst of speed which is going to be caused by a puff of wind generally we can see that she is falling behind here um she's missing the Puffs again you're not seeing that rapidly shrinking area that you're seeing on Juliet as she's accelerating she's really now she's trying to steer up a bit maybe to escape to get away from the pack that never works you can steer down to get out of the wind Shadow but steering up now you're just basically getting deeper into it because the wind Shadow actually does extend as you can see here if you look at Juliet far up wind and finally she's going to attack and get out of there after falling way behind so here's another example um using the 3D wind Shadow you can see these are two Meli meles 24 and the one boat 15 is right here behind 24 now he's been hanging out at sort of the edge of the wind Shadow doing okay we can see that he's holding the speed pretty pretty steady starting to slow down a bit now 53 57 55 now he's actually going faster so he's hanging in there knowing that he's still keeping his boat speed and what he's doing is is he's just waiting for a clear Lane to tack there's a lot a lot of other boats over here this is a very busy race and as soon as he is slowing down in there he sees his Lane he takes it and he gets out of there and that's what you want to see you don't want to be waiting and really suffering in a windshadow if they're somewhere else that you can go also make sure to use those loose and tight covers when they're appropriate not just because you can and end up losing the race to the rest of the fleet I'll see you next time for our Lee B podcast if you enjoyed

[Music] welcome back to race to win the sailing podcast where we evaluate 3D replays of actual races and learn how to sale smarter today we're going to be learning how to understand a really cool feature of the 3D replays here at racec which is the vmg polar charts first of all the vertical access is the true wind direction if we zoom out to the Leg view we click match View and that will bring us into the vmg chart you can also see the vmg depicted here in the histogram on the right vertical or zero is the true in Direction you can see 90° off the wind 45° off the wind and then this white line is our course at the end of the course line you can see some dots you get one dot every second and that dot is going to give you your vmg at that time let's watch Attack the white course line is longer or shorter depending on how fast you going and each of those Rings going out represents two knots so here you can see we're recovering from the tack let's go back a little bit and watch this this one by one one one tacking tacking watch the boat come through watch The Heading change tacking tacking tacking this isn't a very good tack we went all the way through to 90° coming back coming back steuding out look at our speed you can look at it by looking at the length of the white course line or the white course Vector technically or by looking at the speed over on the right hand side we're still recovering from this tack it's not a great Tack and and you can tell that just by looking at those green dots all the green dots that you see are for the last 2 minutes the lighter color ones are fading away so those are older data points and the brighter ones are ones that you just recorded So we call this your tacking pattern you're able to have a visual representation of your boat handling um this is pretty bad right here where I stopped it that was a really not a very good recovery from the tack you see a very wide spread what you want to see is these clouds of dots be really small lots of dots close together that means that you were basically going the same direction most of the time instead of being all over the place kind of like you can see here with this tack recovery so let's switch boats now and see because what happened is as we were messing around recovering from the tack and Alpha Charlie came up and just went right by us because it took so long to recover from that tack so now we're looking at his vmg chart you can see he has a much tighter cloud and here's his tack one two three four remember one dot per second so he got across in 4 seconds in Alpha it took us quite a while so here you can see although um we did catch up a little bit as he was completing his Tack and is getting back up to speed he still has a 12 M lead whereas before that really slow tack he was behind so as we know your talking really does make a big let's look at another example this is a very professional racer look at his Cloud see how that's all those dots are nice and tight together that means he is really in the group and he's like that for the entire race um let's watch him complete attack here we go and then when he goes one two three that's it he's over and right back up to speed um so by analyzing your tacking patterns and the tacking patterns of your competitors using these vmg charts you can really learn a lot about how to improve your boat handling and how to S smarter see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www.rac.com podcast or search for racec VI on iTunes and click subscribe

Title: 20 – UNDERSTANDING THE RACEQS' DASHBOARD
URL: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sFS2jDF4wS8
Channel: Race To Win Sailing Podcast
Language: English (auto-generated)
Transcript:
[Music] Hey guys, and welcome back to Race to Win, the sailing podcast, where we use 3D replays of actual sailboat races to discuss racing tactics, the rules, techniques, and lots more. So today we're going to look at the Race Q's 3D replay engine and go over some of the basic features. In this replay we have two other boats. Now I have randomized this race so that you can't see the actual boat names to protect the innocent or guilty. Who knows? And you can see this was in San Francisco Bay. There's the city front Golden Gate Bridge. It's pretty cool, right? There's a lot of different things happening here. A lot of buttons. The functionality of this thing is really amazing. So let's start with the most basic thing. The very first thing you're going to see, which is the dashboard here on the right, you have six gadgets available to you. VMG, speed overground, course overground, compass heading, drift, and heel. Sounds great, right? If you just record a replay with your phone, and you have it in your pocket or maybe in your bag, you're only going to get these first three gadgets here. In order to get these last three, the phone actually needs to be moving with your boat to sense that. And there's directions in the app, too. So, what these actually are are histograms that are flattened out. Each of these colors is a data point. The Race Q's app is picking up data from your boat every second. And so, every second, boop, a little dot appears. And the way that these histograms work, each tenth of a knot increment has its own shade of color. The darker the shade, the more the plot has appeared. This is showing you everything that's happened to your boat for your VMG in the last 2 minutes. And remember, VMG is velocity made good. So sometime in the last 2 minutes, we dropped all the way down here, and we also were all the way up here. But most of the time, we've been in these darker areas. So, this little red line, let's push play so you can see. That's what we're doing right now. We Oh, good. We're accelerating. Thank goodness. Now, you also see there's a little black triangle right here. That's the mean, um, sort of the average of all these data points, and the red is the target. So, the race Q's app actually takes into account all this data, and it tells you what it thinks you should be doing. You should be doing at least this good. This is your target VMG given what it guesses is the wind speed direction etc. And that's the same for all of these. The black triangle is the mean. The red one is the target. So now that you know the darker spots are where you've been the most. As you hit play, you can kind of start to see how you've been doing on different legs of the race. you can look at it and and see where you are just visually using the darker spots of color. So, let's take a look at these first three gadgets which you'll get when you record with the Race Q's app. Whether it's mounted or not, you can stick it in your pocket, you'll still get these. You've got your VMG, which is your velocity made good. That's just how good you're doing at trying to get where you're going upwind directly upwind in this case. The speed over the ground is is how good you're actually doing really in real life against the bottom of the ocean. And then your course over the ground, that is the actual course of your boat, the way that you were moving after all the forces being acted on you have played out, the wind, the current, etc. So, you've got your compass heading where you're pointing and your course over ground where you're actually going. And we'll get back to that. Now, if you upload a track and you don't see your VMG yet, you need to go over here and make sure that you have the course set up. Um, it's pretty easy. You can just add waypoints right like this. And I'm going to do a whole another podcast on how to set up your course. But as long as you have a start line and at least one mark, then the app will be able to figure out the wind direction and will give you that VMG. Let's take a look at these next ones. heading, drift, and heel. These are the three that you get if your phone is mounted. You'll notice that most of the things in the interface you see in 2D and then also in 3D depicted in different ways. So, right now you have two lines coming out the front of the boat. One of them indicates your course over ground and the other one shows you your compass heading and then the distance between the two is your drift. So, as they get wider and wider apart, some force was acting on your boat to cause drift. So, your boat's pointing this way, but you're actually going that way. So, now I want to talk about the last thing, which is your angle of heel. Basically, flat is fast, right? So, from this angle, remember your phone was stuck down to your boat. It was moving with your boat. So, this is an accurate representation of what was actually happening. Okay. So, here we are sailing upwind. We can look at our heel angle for the last 2 minutes. So, whoa, here we go. Whoa, big puff. Look at that. You can see we turned up in the puff a little bit and watch things as they're happening. So, that pretty much sums up these gadgets. If you're not using one and you want to turn it off, just click on the name and it will minimize it. Remember, 120 little data points for the last two minutes. We get one every second. The darker colors are where you were most of the time. You'll always have speed over the ground, course over ground, and VMG as long as you remember to go over here to settings and set up at least a starting line and a mark. And you will get the last three, compass, heading, drift, and heel if you mount your phone. See you next time.

Channel: Race To Win Sailing Podcast

Transcript:
[Music] Welcome to Race to Win the sailing podcast where we use 3D replays of actual races to discuss strategies, racing tactics, and more. So, we're going to pick up where we left off in the last podcast, which was talking about mainetail twist. If you're new to the series, you're going to want to go back and start with the first one that explains exactly how we make this video that you're seeing here. Basically, we've just taken a GoPro and screwed it directly into the main cell headboard. Then we take that video footage and we sync it with a 3D replay using the Race Q's Geo Vids program to get these really amazing videos that we can analyze all kinds of things. So when we left off we were talking about main sale twist. And I just want to finish up by saying there's a really easy way to tell if you have enough twist. Um, when you're in the groove, you're sailing along, you know, you're on one of those long beats, you want to make sure that you're trimmed for the best power and pointing abilities that you can get out of the boat. In most normal conditions, if you have enough twist, when you're looking up at the main, that upper telltale should be breaking half of the time. So, it will sort of hide behind the main and come back equally 50%. And when it's doing that, you have good power and good pointing ability. Interestingly, even though everybody is obsessed with watching the jib telltells, it's really more important to make sure you have proper twist and to be watching that upper telltale on your main. Now, we're going to just pause the video here and we're going to do some more evaluations on our main shape using that UK Hley Acmeasure software that we talked about before. It's free. Here's a link again if you've been watching the series. Um, now I've already put all of the splines in the upper, middle, and lower on the main. And now we're going to look at how to evaluate those. It's really easy. You just click and drag them all on. Again, go back to the first podcast for more information. So, let's look at this upper. And we can see we get a lot of stats here. Um, let's talk about the draft, also known as the camber. So most of the draft in your sail is sewn in. It's what the sail maker gives it. You can change it a little by bending the mast. And when you start to hear about sails that are being blown out, that means they have the draft is too deep. They're not good anymore. So the draft in the first and second draft stripe is controlled by the mast bend and the draft at the bottom is controlled by the out hole. So more draft gives you more power. So deeper draft, deeper belly is more power, but it's also a slower shape. You can't point as well. You can't get as far up wind with that deep powerful draft. But if you want to accelerate, like accelerating out of attack, for example, or accelerating from a dead stop at the start, you want that deep draft to give you that torque, that power to go from a stop to a start. Now, a less draft, which is shallower, gives you more pointing ability. So, if you're already up to speed, then that's when you're going to reduce the draft a little bit and give your sail more pointing ability because you don't need the power. Draft is measured as a percentage. And the rule of thumb is you want to have between 9 to 15% on the main depending on your sail maker. If it's more than that, it's usually blown out. Now, of course, it also depends on your rig and configuration. And the percentage can be a little different at different heights of the sail. So you want to measure at the top, the middle and the bottom. And the next thing is to look at is the draft position which is also measured in a percentage. And Acmeasure will give that to you. For the main, you want the position to be between 40 to 50%. Never more than 50%. And the whole point of draft position is when the draft is slightly forward, it gives you more power but a little less pointing ability. When you move the draft aft, it gives you a very narrow groove to drive in, but you will point better and faster. Draft position is controlled mostly by howard tension and also the Cunningham. From this vantage point, we have a really clear view of the outall. So, it's easy to evaluate how we had things trimmed and see how that affected our draft position. So, you can use Acmeasure to measure the amount of draft position and even the amount of twist. So, that's great and all, but what's the point? And what you need to remember is just by watching your GoPro video, yes, you can see your sail trim, but you have no idea how that actually affected your performance. I know that if I close the leash a little bit, it's going to help me point better, but it will also increase my drag. So, how did that really affect my performance over time? And that's something that can take thousands of hours on the boat to evaluate and get that sense of how much is just the right amount. Using this system, you can mathematically figure it out. You can look at how your sales were trimmed when you were performing well in different conditions in different races. We have a whole podcast in the works about the best way to interpret this polar chart, but this is what we've developed to evaluate our geo vids. These scatter plots show you your performance for the last 2 minutes. And you can see your VMG, your drift, how your course and heading have changed, and then go back and see what you did differently with your sail trim or your crew work that changed your performance. So that's all for today. Please remember to give us a review on iTunes and we'll see you next time.

Title: 19 - The Jib: View From The Top Part 4

Channel: Race To Win Sailing Podcast

Transcript:
[Music] Welcome to Race to Win, the sailing podcast, where we use 3D replays of actual races to discuss strategies, racing tactics, and more. This is the final podcast in a four-part series going over what we can learn using geo vids with a view from the top of the mast. If you're new to the series, you're going to want to go back and start with the first one that explains exactly how we make this video that you're seeing here. Basically, we've just taken a GoPro and screwed it directly into the main cell headboard. Then we take that video footage and we sync it with a 3D replay using the Race Q's Geo Vids program to get these really amazing videos that we can use to analyze our performance in a unique way. At the end of the last series, we talked about the main sail draft depth and draft position and how that affected your trim and speed. So now we're going to move a little bit forward on the boat and talk about the same parameters on the jib. The first thing that's super obvious is the headstay sag. we have a very clear view of how much headstay sag you have. Now that's controlled by the backstay. It's really your powering and depowering tool. If you need more power, slack in the back stay. It really drastically changes the draft and shape of the jib. And it's really the only way to control the draft on the jib is by changing your head stay sag. It really improves your pointing ability, but less power for acceleration to have that nice flat jib. The amount of draft you want on the jib is usually between 10 and 17%. Again, controlled mostly by the headstay. On the bottom section, though, it will be controlled by the sheet tension and car position. Now that you can find draft depth, let's look at the draft position. This is controlled by the jib howiard tension. The tighter tension you have on your Howiard, that's going to move your draft forward and give you a wider groove to steer in. Um, for beginning drivers, you are going to want a tight tension to give yourself a little bit more room for error. You'll lose a bit of pointing ability, but overall, you're going to go faster because you'll be controlling your boat a little better. And your draft position should be at about 30 to 40% if your jib is cut correctly. Most people know how to fly the jib telltel, so just know that you can see them from the top. And again, evaluate your trim versus your speed using the geo vit. And then the last thing you can see from up here is the car position. If you move the car aft, you're going to get more twist by opening up the leech, which is going to give you more acceleration, but a little less pointing ability. And again, you can measure the twist by looking at the leech of the jib against the spreader. Generally, if you move the car forward, you're going to close the leech. By the way, if you don't adjust your sheet tension and just move the car around, you probably won't get the result that you're looking for. You need to look at the twist on the spreader and adjust things accordingly. You might need more or less sheet tension. The point is to see how you were doing at this view from the top and then adjust it to that parameter. And we'll discuss how this all affects your performance later on. But I think that's enough for one podcast and you can see some more things that this view from the top really gives you the opportunity to evaluate. Again, the general point is keep making these videos and then you develop a catalog of them over time. You can see how the sails were trimmed when you did poorly, how the sails were trimmed when you were doing well, and and begin to learn the trim that works well for you on your boat and your crew in varying conditions. And that's the kind of thing that's really going to help you improve at the higher levels of sailing. That's all for today. See you next time.

Transcript:
welcome to race to win a sailing podcast brought to you by race we review 3d regatta replays and analyze racing rules tactics and winning strategies my name is jaqen and today's podcast is about tacking which as i've mentioned in several previous podcasts is the one thing you have to do that slows the boat down okay to be fair rounding the lured mark also slows the boat down but this podcast is about tacking the goal of tacking is to absolutely minimize how much you lose in the tack alright so we're going to review this replay which is from an amateur wednesday night series on long island sound in one design boats and you'll see i have two boats selected and they're both about to tack you'll also note that behind each boat's tack are the green and red trajectory lines that race cues displays when a skipper is sailing in the groove meaning that they have a pretty low variation in their heading and speed and race cues is able to compute a really meaningful average from that data you'll also see that after each tac neither one of them has a trajectory line until quite a ways after the attack okay let me switch the view here and i'll zoom in a little bit and now i'm going to click on alpha's trajectory line and you'll see that they were sailing at 4.1 knots for a vmg of three knots whereas bravo was going a little bit faster but not pointing as high also making a vmg of three knots all right next i can click on the tacking icon it's important to note before i discuss all the data here that that little tacking icon will only display if it's attached to a trajectory line race cues will not compute you as have intact unless you were sailing in the groove either before or after the tack all right so here's the attacking data for bravo and i'm just going to pause the replay here for a little while so we can talk about this because there's quite a bit of data available here first i want to talk about the tacking angle attacking angle refers to the difference in courses between the average course the boat was steering before they tacked and the average course they were steering after they attacked now different boats will have different tacking angles depending on how close they can point to the wind but in this case they tacked through a 93 degree angle next you'll see the metric over steering over steering refers to how far below that tacking angle they went after attacking before coming back up to an average course and really finishing their attack and being on close haul on the other attack now a perfect tack will include some over steering because you always want to attack to a speed build heading before coming back up to a full close haul next you'll see min sog and min vmg or minimum speed over ground and minimum velocity made good and those are pretty self-explanatory they represent the lowest point your speed over ground and vmg hit during your attack the next piece of information is the duration of your attack in this case four seconds and that's how long it takes you to go through the 93 degree tacking angle it does not describe how long it takes you to recover meaning to get back up to your full heading and full speed that's the next one recovery so in this case it takes bravo quite a bit of time to get back up to the same speed and heading that they were at um or rather not the same speed and heading but the same speed and angle to the wind that they were at prior to the attack race cues then uses all of that data to compute how much time you lost in your attack remember it's possible to gain ground directly to windward during attack so even if you have a poor recovery you can still have a decent tack which is what happens with bravo here only losing four seconds during their attack now just for the sake of comparison i'm gonna switch recordings to um mel just24 worlds from 2013 and show you a replay of one of the absolute best sailors in the world who was skippering this boat in melbourne's 24 worlds now the melody's 24 is notoriously difficult to find the groove when sailing upwind because it's a wide round bottom boat but you can see here that this skipper has a trajectory line before and after the tack all the way up the course he's in the groove the entire way so let me just zoom out a little bit to make it clear how well he was steering throughout this race all right now i'm going to zoom back in you can see that just after the attack the trajectory line actually disappears so just like anyone he's at a speed build angle trying to find the groove now if i click the tack button you can see that the attacking angle was just 73 degrees but it still involved 16 degrees of oversteering that's the speed build but in notable contrast to the amateurs we were watching earlier his speed over ground drops just two knots to 5.1 during the attack and his recovery takes only 10 seconds relative to the 20 plus we were seeing with the amateurs when it's all done he's lost only two seconds during the tack i know that's a lot of information to take in in one podcast so i appreciate your patience thanks for tuning in to the racefuse podcast make sure to leave us a review on itunes and check out our website at www.racecues.com podcast i'll be back in a couple weeks with more on tacking so you'll have plenty of time to get out there use rescues and analyze a few of your own tax see if you can get the time lost down to as little as possible thanks and see you next time

Title: 16 - The View From The Top: Part 2

Transcript:
[Music] Welcome back to Race to Win, the sailing podcast, where we use 3D replays of actual races to discuss tactics, rules, and winning strategies. So, this is part two in a series called the view from the top, which is where we mount a GoPro on the main sale headboard and then evaluate the footage in different ways. Um, in the original podcast, we give you detailed instructions on mounting and direct you to some free software to help you get the draft and things like that. So, if you want those instructions, please go back and watch the first podcast in the series. Today I'm going to go over the things we can get by just watching the geovid without any software at all. So the first thing I want to talk about is when we're watching our video from the top, we can see the tiller movements quite clearly. And I'm just going to zoom in a bit. And here we can get a look at tiller angle and weather helm. So, if you have a wheel instead of a tiller, you can still make these same measurements by making an obvious mark on your wheel at the center line and then use the stern mount geo vid. And the concept remains exactly the same. So, I'm just going to draw a line at what center would be for the tiller. When you're going up wind in most boats, you want to have about 3 to 5° of weather helm. Anything more than five degrees is excessive and less than about three degrees is leelm and that slows you down too. Our weather helm looks okay, maybe a little strong. Um, if you see too much weatherhelm or lehelm, it's most likely that your mast rake is incorrect. Although, of course, it could be a multitude of things. In addition to looking at your weather helm, you want to watch how much you are actually moving the tiller or the wheel. On a well balanced boat, the tiller should only be moving in that same three to five degree zone as we do for the weather helm. Watch and see how much tiller movement you are doing. If you're steering all over the place, um you're probably overcorrecting, which is definitely more common with an inexperienced helmsman. Also, it's fairly likely that your trim is out of balance. So, if you find yourself really oversteering a lot, you should practice driving the boat with just the main and holding the tiller steady. When you pull the main to windward, that's going to drive the boat down and lowering the main to lureed will drive the boat up. The main trimmer should be using the sheet to do most of the driving of the boat, unless of course it's super choppy. So, you're driving the boat with the main and the tiller is just telling you how much pressure there is on the rudder, which is one of your foils under the boat along with your keel. Now, we can't feel how much pressure is on the keel, but we can feel that pressure on the rudder, and it helps us figure out our proper trim. Unless, of course, you're turning or tacking, then you want your rudder, and you're going to be moving the tiller more. So, let's move forward along the boat a little bit and look at the boom angle. The view from the top gives us a great vantage point on the boom. Unless it's really windy, your boom should be right on the center line or just about 5° to lure. You can really use this tool to evaluate how well your main trimmer is anticipating and dealing with the puffs. So, how do you know if there's a puff? This is a video. Um, what we're going to do is turn on the polar chart. That is an overlay that shows among other things the angle of heel. So when there's a big puff and the boat heals a lot, we can see it right here. So let's look for a point where we have a lot of heel up wind. And then we'll watch the geo vid and check if the main trimmer has traveled down enough to keep you from going over on your ear from healing. The boom angle is controlled by the traveler. A lot of people just lock the traveler and then get knocked down in the puffs, which really slows you down. And the last thing I want to talk about in this podcast is main twist. Main Twist is pretty much a completely separate podcast all by itself. It'll probably be the next one, but I want to introduce the concept because it is so important and we have such a great vantage point using these geo vids with the angle from the top. So main twist is the change in the angle of attack from the bottom of the sail to the top. Not a big deal if you're a cruiser, but if you're a racer, you want to trim your sail to take full advantage of the available winds. We do this by controlling the twist of the leech of the main sail, which is the back part of it. You control twist by pulling or easing the leech with the main sheet or the boom bang. So, this idea of trimming your twist has become more and more important on modern boats as these main sails seem to be getting just bigger and bigger. I feel like the roach on some of these new racing sails are so big that you practically need a gaff to hold it up. Experts agree that having proper twist up wind can be the single biggest factor in upwind boat speed. So get your twist right and win the race. So how do we see it? Um with this view it's really easy. Just find the top batten and draw the line from the top bat to the mast. Now draw the same line at the boom and then compare those two to see how much twist you have. The amount of twist you want is different for different boats in different conditions. Basically, you want to find out when your boat is in the groove. And note your twist. For most people in average conditions, that's going to be at about 50% twist. So that's all for today. We're going to talk a lot more about this stuff next time, uh, including telltale positions, draft, headstay, sag, maybe even jib car position if we have time. I don't want to give it all away. In the meantime, try to find someone from your fleet who is better than you and help them to make one of these top view geo vids because looking at their race is going to be your very best learning tool as to how you can sail your boat faster. See you next time. If you enjoyed this podcast, you can find more on our website www.racusees.com/mpodcast racecues.com/mpodcast or search for Racecues on iTunes and click subscribe. [Music]

Title: 15 - Two Pros Duel on the Upwind Leg

Transcript:
welcome to race to win the sailing podcast brought to you by racecues.com we review 3d regatta replays and analyze racing tactics rules and winning strategies this podcast is the story of two boats vying for upwind supremacy in a regatta off croatia in the adriatic sea um it's a real regatta we just changed the boat names to keep everything private and you can see on the right i have one of the boats selected alpha and we're about halfway through the pre-start alpha is just going to attack and jive around trying to get their time and distance to the line just right you can see on the left the other boat delta is also trying to secure their lane for a perfect start and here we go let's see how they do you'll note that next to each boat's name or the abbreviated name the race piece tool is displaying the boat's speed so 5.4 knots 5.1 knots etcetera all right so here comes alpha up on the committee boat they're just going to shoot head to wind real fast and then duck down and start you see the little spinnaker graphic go up there sometimes the tool will interpret a boat that's going downwind to be flying spinnaker where of course alpha didn't fly spinnaker for a second and a half during the pre-start there okay i've switched to the top-down view or the leg view as we call it and you can see both boats are making their way upwind they've got a pretty similar angle and pretty similar speeds behind each boat i have the track turned on and right there that's called the trajectory lines that's a default part of the leg view but i'm going to turn it off for a moment and we'll talk about those in a moment all right so you can see that the track line behind each boat is color coded the closer it is to red the faster they're going the closer it is to blue the dark the the slower they're going so here after delta tax you're gonna see their line goes up to yellow that's quite fast because they've uh their footing a little bit after they're attacked to build up speed both both of the drivers in these boats are really top-notch professionals so we're going to get to watch a great upwind lag all right next thing i'm going to do is turn on the separation tool the separation tool basically shows exactly how far apart the ladder runs that each boat is on and you can see right here that they're 23 meters apart delta is leading by 23 meters so i'm going to hit play i sped it up a little bit and of course alpha has to attack again um so they don't get too separated from delta and delta doesn't build up too much leverage and that gave delta about another 15 meters of lead so they lost one or two boat lines in that attack so we're sailing along the separation is um remaining fairly constant although alpha's making up some ground and you can see the ley line on the horizon there as well as some beautiful mediterranean islands okay the next tool i want to show you is that trajectory line that i was talking about so i'm going to turn off the tracks so we don't get confused and turn on the trajectory line you'll see these are not color coded there's just one for each boat same color consistent and what's cool about the trajectory line is that wherever it's solid you know a boat was in the groove they were steering a fairly constant speed and angle you can click any of these solid sections and get a coarse speed and a vmg so 5.9 3.9 5.4 3.9 so for that section delta is going slower but they're pointed higher and they're making the same vmg up there you can see that delta actually gets a lift a little before alpha gets it and that allows them to get up onto sort of the same track as alpha and make even more ground on alpha okay let me skip forward a little bit to their tack and talk about another feature of the trajectory lines okay here they are they're about to tack and you'll see that on the trajectory lines there's a little white dot with a t in it that's the same white dot with the t that appears on the timeline at the bottom of the screen that i used to skip forward that represents attack now if i click on it i get attacking angle i get how much they oversteered i get how low their speed over ground and bmg dropped and i get duration and time lost you can see here that alpha lost three seconds more than delta and i'm hypothesizing that that's because their attacking angle was much smaller it was 20 degrees smaller they never went into a footing speed build mode after their attack if i click on the match mode which displays the vmg tool you'll see you'll see a display a polar display of alpha's course and speed the further the dot is from alpha the faster they were going and of course the angle is the angle each dot represents one second of data on alpha normally after their attack you would expect them to have one or two dots that are lower than their average cluster and that's their speed build footing section you can see here that alpha doesn't have that and i think that's why they lost a few more seconds than delta on their last tap you can also see that ley lines start to approach them on the right i'll zoom out a little bit and the polar chart tool will keep getting bigger as i zoom out so let me turn that off and i'm going to hit play now watch the ley lines shift around as the breeze shifts right now both boats are over the lay line and laying the mark and now it's going back they're not going to make it it's going way back they're not going to make it i'm going to skip forward on the leg and you'll see what happens okay so first i'm going to turn the tracks back on and then i'm going to use the timeline tool again at the bottom to skip forward but i don't want to skip past the red marks because i still want to look at this leg so i'm just going to click a little bit further and you'll see that that righty came back and the ley lines are way off to the left you'll also see that alpha threw in two extra tax presumably because they were worried they weren't going to make the mark now delta is pretty close to not making the mark as well but we're just going to see alpha of course is hoping that delta their competitor in this race has to throw in two more tags one cool feature if i click this little versus button between alpha and delta you can see all the data for those two boats on that lake they sailed almost exactly the same distance um within a hundredth of a nautical mile which is so cool uh they're both very very good um but delta was just four percent faster on average upwind and that was the major difference of course alpha also threw into more tax and that took some extra time as well overall delta was able to sail the leg 52 seconds faster just because they were going ever so slightly faster and at the highest level that's how it breaks down you know it's four percent it's one percent it's 0.04 percent that makes the difference between winning and losing race you can even watch uh from alpha's perspective as delta rounds the mark this is sort of what it looks like to be alpha you can tell that you're way over the ley line of course that way line is in your head when you're actually sailing and you're hoping yourself that man they're pinching up they're pinching up they're going to have to attack they're definitely going to have to tack and let's see here i'll go back to the fleet view and in fact delta does not have to pack you see they get really slow that blue track as they pinched around the mark but they don't have to throw in two more tacks and they get to hold that pretty solid lead against alpha overall though really impressive upwind leg from two top-notch boats in the adriatic i hope you've enjoyed this podcast please check out our website www.racecues.compodcast or leave us a review on itunes and

Title: 14- The View From The Top: Using GeoVids to Analyze Sail Shape

Channel: Race To Win Sailing Podcast
Language: English (auto-generated)
Transcript:
[Music] welcome back to race to win the sing podcast where we discuss winning tactics race strategies and more today I'm going to show you how to use geov vids to evaluate your Sal shape just like the pros totally for free in case you're just joining us geoids is where you can buy action camera footage like from a GoPro with the race Q's 3D replay so instead of seeing just a 3D replay you see both your camera footage and the replay synced side by side the opportunities for advanced analytics are really endless with Geo vids um for example we have now started creating Mast head Geo vids the view from the top it's pretty cool so bet you're wondering how the heck we got this camera angle um it's really pretty simple most main Sals have a hard structural headboard right where you attach the halard so all we did was bolt a regular GoPro Mount directly onto that headboard we also glued it just to be extra safe um we have tested this in up to about 30 knots of wind and the thing has stayed mounted even with some fogging of the main but that being said you might want to install some sort of safety lanyard just in case and obviously if your GoPro falls off your main don't blame me it's not my fault um this is just an idea that we've had and has been working really well so just attach the mount to the headboard put on your GoPro and raise the main sale like usual it's a pretty nifty way to get a mast head video so one thing that's come up a bit is when people are using geov vids they think they have to use a GoPro you can upload any video from an action camera that you want um we just like GoPro because it's the smallest and lightest camera and when you're putting your camera at the top of your mask you really don't want a big heavy camera just hanging on for dear life up there we like the low profile of the GoPro personally and we also like that it has Wi-Fi which Probably sounds a little ridiculous why do I need Wi-Fi on my camera on my boat well when you have your camera at the top of your mask it's really nice to be able to start and stop it without having to bring the M up and down so Wi-Fi lets you do all that remotely it also syncs the time in the camera with the time in your phone so that you don't have issues with time stamps and syncing later on in Ju ofits our testers found that with Wi-Fi on the battery lasted about 1 and 1 half to 2 hours and with the Wi-Fi off it lasted about 3 hours so depending on your point of sale and your tack you're going to get a lot of different Vantage points and angles on both the main and the jib and your crew below this technology has about a million different applications and I'm pretty excited about all of our upcoming podcasts discussing it with Sal makers and other experts in the field in the meantime I want to show you how to analyze your Sal shape for free using your geovid and another free tool called acum measure by UK howy salemers so the first step to analyzing your Sal shape on your own is to create one of these Mast head geoids by putting the camera at the top of the Mast running it and then also running your race cu's phone app come back upload everything to your computer and the ju ofid software will give you this synced image now go through and pick some moments that you want to analyze your Sal shape maybe you see that your speed has dropped a bunch and you are not sure why and you're wondering if maybe on this tack your trim wasn't as good as it could have been so when you find that moment just pause your video and then you're going to just make a screenshot of that time in your video so save your print screen and then you need to download the tool from UK housy Salem makers acum measure so it's a quick easy download um open it up and then open up your picture that you just grabbed now you need to match up each spline to the upper middle and lower draft Stripes it's really easy the only hard part I found is that you have to move Each corner individually you can't drag the whole thing across the screen so you're going to pin the upper middle and lower like you see me doing here and you want to make your best guessed for the ends like you can see on my upper stripe it's kind of behind the for stay there so I just sort of guess and then use the other controls to get it as close to my draft stripe as possible so after you pin everything maum measure calculates the information about your draft position the Twist and it also gives you your 75% and 15% on your camera so for some people that are into analyzing this kind of stuff this is really exciting if this is a little bit over your head don't worry I'm going to do another podcast with a salemaker explaining to you just why this is important but for today I just wanted to show you this because I think it is really a cool way to be able to analyze your sale trim hey and if you have a minute I'd really appreciate it if you went in and gave us a review on iTunes and shared our podcast

Title: 13 - Velocity Made Good

Channel: Race To Win Sailing Podcast
Language: English (auto-generated)
Transcript:
welcome to a race to win a sailing podcast brought to you by race news.com we review 3d regatta replays and analyze racing tactics rules and winning strategies this is the fifth in a series of podcasts about upwind race geometry in my last podcast I talked about how essential it is to sail as close to the wind as possible so that you sail the minimum possible distance on the upwind leg in this podcast I'm going to talk about V M G or velocity made good what is V M G put simply V M G is the amount of progress you are making directly upwind or directly downwind depending on what leg of the course you're on let me draw some lines on the course and show you what I'm talking about if you'll go back to high school physics with me for a moment you'll recall that the velocity of Lima the boat I have selected here can be divided into vectors one vector would be going to the left across the course and the other vector would be going directly upwind when these two vectors are combined you get the approximately five knots that Lima is making on their close hauled course to windward velocity made good is the measurement of the direct to windward vector race Q's has a number of tools built in to help you assess your velocity made good at any given point on the race the first tool is the trajectory lines which I introduced in the last podcast if you click on a section of a boats trajectory line you will see the average course speed and velocity made good that that boat was sailing on that section of the course one important thing to note here is that the algorithm raised Q's uses to average a boat's course speed and VMG will not do so if it is too widely distributed what that means is that if a boat is sailing all over the map race crews won't display a trajectory line for that section of their course so it's pretty easy to tell how good a skipper of any given boat is based on how solid their trajectory lines are if they're sailing within a very narrow range and they're holding essentially the same course speed and BMG then race crews will display a trajectory line and you'll be able to click it and get the average for that section if on the other hand they're not responding well to the puffs and they're over correcting their steering in the ship's race crews probably won't be able to average that section very well and therefore won't display a trajectory line for that section of their track ok the next tool I want to introduce you to is called the vmg display the vmg display much like the trajectory line is a very useful tool for learning how to become a better skipper I've pulled it up here and you can see a bunch of green dots coming out of limas bow the dots represent her angle to windward and the speed she's going the farther the dots are from Lima the faster she's going and of course the angle on the polar chart represents the angle she's sailing at that particular moment slowly the dots will fade away so the brighter the dot the more recent data it's representing a really talented skipper will have a very narrow cluster of dots a very small cluster meaning that they're holding the same course and speed despite the wind shifts the puffs and the chopped' a less experienced skipper will have a wider spread I'm going to switch boats and switch to a little bit earlier in the race and show you a skipper that has a little bit more experience you can see here that Bravo's cluster of dots is very narrow especially once they settled into the groove after the tack all of the bright dots the more recent ones are right on top of each other so he's doing a really good job of holding his course and his speed now I'm going to switch to a even less experienced skipper and Foxtrot and show you what a wider spread looks like here you can see that Foxtrot is really having trouble holding its course and holding a speed it's a pretty wide spread I think it's a pretty common mistake among less experienced sailors to correct more than is actually necessary it's a natural instinct to want to compensate for the shift and conditions and beginners tend to do it more than they ought to it was a puffy day with a little bit of chop and if i zoom in you'll also see that Foxtrot is struggling in the dirty air of another boat which also explains their widespread okay I'm going to switch to the downwind leg and talk about velocity made good versus velocity made to course or VMC velocity made good is the measurement of a boat's progress directly upwind or directly downwind in other words the measurement of that vector V MC or velocity made to course is the measurement of the vector that's pointing toward a boat's destination you can see here that Leamas speed and their vmg are nearly identical that's because it's a downwind leg and they're pointing directly at the mark it's important to note here that race Q's uses v MC for reaching legs and downwind legs and v mg for upwind legs v MC is also used often in distance racing which is often comprised of mostly reaching legs generally I would say that V MC or velocity made to course is always applicable because it's always measuring the velocity vector to your destination V mg on the other hand is only useful in a direct windward Luard scenario and is not particularly useful when there's any sort of reaching leg involved okay I'm going to turn the vmg tool back on and it's pretty fun to look at how different skippers and spinnaker trimmers do on the downwind relative to have the skipper and the jib trimmer do on the upwind some pairs are really talented at keeping a nice tight spread going upwind and some are much more talented going downwind you can see here that kilo has a slightly better spread than Lima and if I go to India you see a really nice tight spread on this downwind leg they're doing a great job of holding a steady course okay that's it for this week's episode of race to win I hope you've enjoyed it download the race news app and next time you go racing you can measure your own vmg and figure out how to make it even better make sure you leave us a review on iTunes and check out our website at wwlp.com happy sailing see

Title: 12 - Finding the Three Boat-length Zone - Protests and Technology

Channel: Race To Win Sailing Podcast
Language: English (auto-generated)
Transcript:
[Music] hi I'm Julia and welcome to race to win the weekly sailing podcast where we discuss race strategies tactics and more today I'm going to be talking about how we can use modern sailing technology to teach ourselves things on the water like how to have a better sense of where exactly that three booat length zone is at the Mark also I want to spend some time to address a question that's on everybody's mind can we use all this stuff in protest hearings or not as technology is becoming more and more a part of sailboat racing things are changing pretty rapidly both on the water and off there's been a lot of questions about the legality of this Tech being used while we're sailing um all over the world and one of the ones that I'm hearing a lot is can we use these 3D replays the videos as evidence in protest hearings So today we're going to take a look at a unique case where we happen to be running racec geov vids in a protest situation now in case this geov vids that you're seeing is new to you geov vids is a raceu concept that syncs action camera footage with GPS tracks using the timestamps on both of them this is really incredibly useful as you'll see having both your Replay in 3D and all of that data and then being able to see a video and then watching it move synced has all kinds of applications now I do want to warn you this is one part of race cues that probably won't be free forever but if you start using it now and hopefully give us some feedback on the product then you'll have grandfathered rights to software for life so I'll give you the link again later on it's really easy so let's get back to our situation here so here we have two boats that are approaching the mark and you can see that they establish overlap but the outside boat is failing to give room now using the audio in the video I can hear people yelling we don't have rights we don't have rights clearly looking at this they do have rights and some of the other people on the boat can be heard saying that in short there's just a lot of yelling what happened is the lured boat this boat here that should have had rights thought that they were already inside the three boo length Zone when they established overlap which means they would not have been entitled to room at the Mark however as we can see here by watching the replay they were well outside the three boo length Zone we looked at quite a bit of this type of footage and kind of noticed a trend a lot of people think that three bolt length zone is a lot bigger than it actually is if you're someone that's running a video camera on your boat or you have the capability of it try this out um the next time that you're sailing and you reach that lured Mark give a little signal to the camera where you think that three B length Zone begins then you can upload the video on your computer and you'll have a video just like this and you can take a look at how close you were so let's get back this replay these two boats are battling it out and the Lord boat is hanging on um they want room they've figured out that they are entitled to that room at the Mark and they say we want it we want it and now they're going to have to Jive to avoid a collision um they lose a ton of time doing this even though they're in the right so if they take this footage and win the protest they still lost a ton of other boats that aren't visible in the replay during this maneuver so the lesson is it's not always tactically smarter to insist on your rights even if you are right in this case they should have maybe taken a Stern a little bit earlier instead of having to do this quick maneuver if you insist on your rights too long it can cost you dearly no matter what kind of evidence you're bringing to the protest community so back to the original question obviously this boat was fouled so if they take this evidence to the protest hearing is it applicable it's complicated as this Tech spreads this kind of thing is being captured more and more frequently I mean last week we recorded a rata in Norway it's the world's largest overnight rata 950 boats we recorded 420 of them which was crazy and actually 240 of them were live broadcasting um which is just an incredible example of how quickly this is becoming everywhere I mean I'm sure we caught some interesting moments in that rata which you might be hearing about in a podcast soon um but it still is a little complicated when you bring this to the protest committee the burden of proof is always on you to to prove that this technology is accurate um it's certainly a lot better than he said she said but there is some degree of error um especially in the timing for example if your clock is off by a few seconds on your cell phone your track will be behind you start looking at things like how many satellites were your was your GPS using when you capture this where was each GPS positioned on the boat so it's evidence but not hard proof so now let's talk about the video the video by itself isn't really very good proof because it's lacking depth of field but when you put the video with the GPS track now they're kind of backing each other up so that definitely makes a stronger case like here they're obviously overlapped and they're nowhere near the three boat link Zone we can see it on both screens so basically the answer is yes it is evidence but it's not hard evidence you're still going to have to make your case but you should go download the geovid software because it's free for right now and then you can record your race on both your camera and your phone and check out how far you think it is to the three boo length Zone and if you happen to capture any crazy moments be sure to send me an email so that I can interview you for a future podcast see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www.rac.com SLP podcast or search for race cues on iTunes and click subscribe we would love to

welcome to a race to win a sailing podcast brought to you by race news.com we review 3b regatta replays and analyze racing tactics rules and winning strategies my name is jaqen and today's podcast is about sailing close to the wind in my previous podcast which was also from this one design race in Scotland I showed how it's essential to stay in sync with the ships that means tacking on the headers and always staying on the lift attack to minimize the distance sail to the windward mark on this podcast I'm going to show you two boats that sail the exact same upwind leg except that Bravo in red sails much more distance than Delta in green what's going on here is the Delta is sailing much closer to the wind than Bravo though ostensibly they're both on a close hauled course Bravo is betting that the greater speed they get by a slightly wider course will make up for the greater distance they have to sail and as we watch the separation grow between Delta and Bravo we can see it's really not paying off for them Delta with their very tight close hauled course is making ground up the ladder rungs much faster than Bravo what's cool about this example is that Delta and Bravo sail essentially the same course they both make three tacks on the windward leg they tack on the same shifts but throughout Delta is really sailing a very tight close hold and Bravo is sailing very loose close hauled and it ends up hurting Bravo to the tune of several hundred meters by the time they get to the windward mark I'm gonna skip ahead a little bit here and we'll be able to look at the entire tracks and you'll see exactly how much more distance Bravo sailed despite doing essentially the same course as Delta all right here it is and you can see that they're just they're drawing a much bigger zigzag on their way up to the women mark if I click the info tab you can see that Delta sailed 22% less distance than Bravo for a total time gain of two minutes and 42 seconds simply by sailing closer to the women Bravo how much closer were they sailing the next tool I want to introduce you to is called the trajectory lines and it's found in the settings tab just above the separation tool it puts on the display trajectory lines in front of the boats who selected and what's really neat about this is you can then click any section of the trajectory lines and see the angle and speed that boat was sailing for that part of the course here Delta was sailing 53 degrees at a speed of five point six knots and Bravo was sailing 41 degrees at his feet of four point four knots a full 12 degrees lower a little bit earlier on the windward leg Delta was sailing 56 degrees and 5.3 knots and Bravo was a full 16 degrees lower at 40 degrees and four point nine months as we look at these trajectory lines it's pretty clear that Bravo was also having sail trim issues because they were both a lower and slower than Delta one possible explanation is that their sails were trimmed for close-hauled but as we can see they were sailing about 10 to 12 degrees below close-hauled that would stall their sails stall the air foils on the sails they wouldn't be getting good flow over the sails and that would explain their slow speed and low point I think this angle really does a great job of show just how much more distance Bravo sailed on that first upwind leg then Delta just by virtue of sailing a much wider course if you're not sailing the type of boat that has instruments to tell you what your ideal angle to the wind is for any given conditions a good technique is to find a competitor before the start of the race and do a speed check so make sure that you're both in clear air and see if you're able to point and maintain speed as well as your competitor if you're not you can know to adjust something with your rig or your sail trim before the race begins that's it for this week's edition of race to win download race cues and check your upwind angles next time you go sailing thanks for tuning in leave us a review on iTunes and don't forget to visit our website at race cruise

Transcript:
hi i'm julia and welcome to race to win the weekly sailing podcast where we discuss race strategies tactics and more today's podcast we're going to be talking about the intricacies of rounding the mark and what you should do if you do happen to accidentally hit it and we're going to be using some exciting new technology to illustrate our points which is the race cues geovids and that's what you see here on the left hand side you have a video that was shot with a gopro or another action camera and then on the right you have the race cues 3d replay the exciting part is that the replay and the video feed are time and geographically synced together as we watch the actions of the sailors on the boat we can see how that directly influence the performance and even watch it in the 3d replay it's pretty neat technology so we're going to use the geovit here to talk about how to avoid hitting the mark it starts with watching the boats in front of you if they're not making the ley line obviously you want to sail a little bit farther than they did before you tack the mistake most people make is they try to make that decision from too far away you want to be just about six or seven boat links from the mark when you make your tack that way you should be close enough to the mark to see what effect the shifting conditions currents and wind are having on the boats that are trying to lay the mark and you should be able to sail far enough that when you do make your attack you won't have problems let's watch what this guy does so here we see him sailing along it's pretty rough conditions and i'm not sure if he meant to lay the mark on this tack he probably did but there is quite a bit of current and wind sweeping him down and away from the mark so he says okay i'm not making this i'm gonna throw in another little tack here to make sure that i can lay the mark and he thought he went far enough but as we can see as he's getting closer to the mark uh uh uh boom hits the mark now i went back and looked at this frame by frame to try to figure out why he had hit the mark because it looked like he was making it and then i noticed that the jib is completely let go right before they hit the mark and that's why they hit the mark and that's a really good example of using a geovid to evaluate a performance the rule used to be you hit the mark you have to do a 360 degree turn that is not the rule anymore now it says if you hit the mark which execute one turn that must include one tac and one jibe so in some situations like if you're on a reach to another reach you may not actually end up going all the way 360 degrees that's okay in this video they hit the mark but they still went around it so that means that they can do their penalty turn somewhere else if they would like to however if you hit the mark and then slid off and went below it you're going to need to make a turn around the mark anyways so that can count as your penalty turn as well it's important to note you hit the mark you can't just keep sailing all the way to the next mark and then say oh this is a good time there's nobody around quick let's flip a 360. the rule says as soon as you are safely able to execute the turn you need to do so so let's say you've hit the mark and you've fouled a boat so you've broken two rules okay so you broke a right-of-way rule you got to do two turns you also hit the mark so you have to do one turn three turns no the rule says when you've broken a rule of part 2 and 31 at the same time you don't have to take a penalty for breaking rule 31. and basically what that means is you only have to do two turns because you don't have to do the turn for the hitting the mark because three turns would just make you dizzy and it's unreasonable so just to sum up avoid hitting the mark by watching the ley lines of the other boats and by not making your attack until you're about six or seven boat lengths from the mark if you do mess up and you still hit the mark as long as you go around it you can take your penalty turn as soon as it is safe remember you have no rights while you're doing your penalty turn however if you miss the mark you're going to have to re-round it which can count as your penalty turn and lastly if you hit the mark and foul somebody within the three boat length zone you're only required to do two penalty turns happy sailing and see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website www.raiseq.com podcast or search for race cues on itunes and click subscribe we would love to hear from you so please give us a review on itunes you

welcome to race to win sailing podcast brought to you by race news.com we review 3d regatta replays and analyze racing tactics rules and winning strategies my name's jaqen and this is the third in a series of podcasts about upwind race geometry I've selected two boats Delta in green on the left and alpha in red on the right and this is from a One Design race in Scotland but the boat names and the date have been changed now you can see that Delta has continued on the starboard tack whereas Alfa has tacked to the port tack after they both got a pretty even start in previous podcasts I've discussed how the latter runs which are imaginary lines perpendicular to the wind are a good way of measuring how much windward progress a boat has made on any given way more black you can see here the Delta is 71 meters farther up the ladder rungs than alpha I've also discussed how going out too wide from the centre of the course is inherently riskier than staying near the centre because it builds leverage relative to the rest of the boats in the fleet and puts you at a bigger risk of gaining or losing from shifts in the wind okay I'm gonna shift views again and back it up a couple seconds and show you how Delta is now gaining ground on alpha and has been from the moment that alpha tact that's because alpha tacked onto the non favored tack and Delta stayed on the favourite tack I'm gonna draw some exaggerated lines on the display to show you what I mean if the wind goes right of center each moment spent on the starboard tack will gain more ground up the ladder runs and towards the windward mark in each moment spent on the port tack I've exaggerated the lines here to show you what I mean but it's pretty clear as we watch the separation grow that Delta was on the favorite tack or what's called the lifted tack and alpha was on the unfavorite tack or the headed tack and so Delta made some pretty big gains now you can see that the wind has actually gone back to the left and delta tacked again so there again on the lifted tack making more ground up the ladder rungs with each moment than alpha and alpha probably feeling that they were building too much leverage and getting out too wide is coming back on a header and losing a lot of ground to Delta if I switched to a top-down view you'll be able to see the much narrower angles toward the windward mark that Delta is sailing relative to alpha and that's how they're gaining so much ground you're not going much faster than alpha they're just sailing less distance let me skip forward a little bit here and we'll see how the windward leg ends up for both of them okay so here we are at the end of the leg and you can see that Delta has extended their lead on alpha pretty significantly now if I click the little info tab on the toolbar it pulls up a large range of data for the leg you're viewing so you can see the top it says leg 1 upwind and this display will display for whatever boat or boats you are currently focused on it displays the distance sailed on that leg the max speed the average speed the number of tacks and most importantly the total time for that leg Delta was feeling a little bit faster than alpha 3 percent but most crucially they were sailing 11% less distance which is what allowed them to complete the wimmer leg a full minute and 30 seconds faster than alpha now this is the important exception to the rule I've talked about in previous podcasts any course on the upwind leg that's within the leylines is only an equal amount of distance if the wind holds steady of course the wind never holds steady it always isolates to some degree therefore it's very important to tack on the headers and always sail the list in order to sail less distance than your competitors that's it for this week's edition of race to win next time you head out sailing download race cues and check your tax and see if you're staying on the lifted tack throughout your up win lick thanks for tuning in leave us a review on iTunes and check out our website at race news.com slash podcast

welcome to race to win a sailing podcast brought to you by race.com we review 3D Riata replays and analyze racing rules tactics and winning strategies my name is jaken and this is the second podcast in a series about upwind race geometry I'm going to use this same j22 rata from Texas that I used for the last upwind geometry podcast because it's just such a great example of what I want to talk about you can see here that I have two boats selected uh frankly Scarlet in green on the left and bling and red on the right and uh they're making their way up the first Winward leg now right here you can see I have the little separation tool turned on bling is leading by about 62 m and remember you can tell which boat is in the lead if you think about the course in terms of ladder rungs so here's a visual of the ladder rungs and as long as the boats are within the lay lines the boat that has advanced farther up the ladder or made it further to Windward is the boat that's in the leap okay the next concept I want to introduce is the rum line um and the actual technical definition of a rum line is fairly complex but in general sailor parament um most people use rum line to mean the straight line between where you are and where you want to go so on this course I'm going to draw the rum line between the center of the start line and the windward Mark okay you can see that most of the fleet uh in fact all of the boats except for bling are basically clustered around the rum line the reason they do that is because the closer you are to the rum line the more conservative your strategy is the further out you get the the way bling is now the more risky it is what bling is doing is called building leverage and just like when a bank builds leverage it comes with a lot of risk let me switch to a top down View and I'll show you what I mean okay let me just um get the view settings set up right zoom in a little bit and um then I will throw in another rum line okay so again the farther you are from a rum line the more you stand to gain if you get the right shift and the more you stand to lose if you get the wrong shift let me draw in some latter rungs to illustrate my point okay so you can see that right here frankly scarlet and bling are basically equal there's 9 meters between them but if the wind were to shift to the left you can see that frankly Scarlet would make enormous Gaines on bling likewise if the wind were to shift to the right bling would make enormous gains on frankly Scarlet in most races the illustrations I'm using would be huge exaggerations in this race they're actually not the wind went that far left and frankly Scarlet gained about 400 meters on bling simply because bling picked the wrong side of the course and built a ton of Leverage on that side okay I'm going to let this play out and as I do I want you to pay attention to the boats that are just to Winward of Frank Scarlet because they're all approximately the same distance from the rum line the giant left shift that comes doesn't change the balance of power that much in that part of the fleet what it does change is the relative placement between frankly scarlet and bling because bling has gone so far outside the rim line and built up so much leverage on the wrong side now most Sailors know that besides rounding the lured Mark tacking is the only required maneuver that slows the boat down therefore there's a very strong incentive to minimize the number of taxs you do on any given Winward leg however if you try to do the minimum number of taxs which is one which means you go all the way out to the lay line and do what's called banging the corner or tack on the lay line and go straight to the mark you really put yourself at risk if you get the wrong shift you're going to be totally screwed because you've built up so much leverage if you get the right shift and you're already on the lay line then you've overstood the L line and sail more than your minimum distance either way going out that far that early is usually a bad option sometimes it's also helpful to think of the line that comes down from the wind and passes through the windward mark this isn't technically the rum line although what we were talking about earlier isn't technically the rum line either but it is a useful way to measure how much risk you're taking by how far outside you've gone on the course if you want to sale a conservative strategy stay close to that line and try to do really good tax if you don't feel your tax are strong go outside but do it with the knowledge that if the wrong shift comes you're going to be in big trouble that's it for this week's episode of Race To Win I hope you enjoyed it if you did please leave us a review on iTunes and make sure you check out our website at www.race.com podcast see you next week and happy sailing

Title: 7- Starting Strategies: The Port Tack Approach

Transcript:
[Music] welcome to race to win a saing podcast brought to you by race.com we analyze race cu's 3D rot replays and review racing tactics rules and winning strategies I'm Julia and today we're going to be discussing my favorite starting strategy which is the port T approach it's a great start but you will need to put on your big girl pants when you scoot across half your Fleet on Port Tac as always you see here the race Q starting box with the green Pacer line showing the correct pace for an ontime start the green box starts shrinking about 1 minute to the starting gun and when that green Pacer line meets the start line that's the start watching this visually makes it really easy to evaluate how good all these boats were at judging their time and distance to this start now this is a replay again from the 2013 melis worlds so a lot of these guys are professional Sailors when I watch this it seems like they have almost a sick sense about when they need to slow down or speed up in order to be on time to the start with good speed a lot of sailors view this port Tac approach it's kind of a desperate move that you don't really want to do um it is certainly one to keep in your back pocket if you end up in a bad situation where you're kind of behind the fleet and it looks like you're really going to be starting new near the back of the pack but I don't think you should discount the port tack approach right off the get-go when you're in a really huge Fleet and it's difficult to find holes using a standard starboard tack approach to the line this port tack approach really can be beneficial in one of the sailing Bibles getting started in sailboat racing by Adam court and Richard Sterns they give a really good example of when you would want to use this port tack approach the example that they use is the Tartan 10 Fleet at the Detroit or Chicago National offshore One Design Riata otherwise known as the nudes um we're talking 40 to 45 boats each of them over 33 ft long all starting at the same time that means a starting line over 2,000 ft long with boats coming at you from every direction it's really close quarters if you asked the competitors they would have said there was hardly any room for all of them to fit on that starting line but there was a sailing photographer named Walter Cooper there taking pictures from the air and when they developed these films this was a while ago when you still had to develop films apparently um they saw big holes in the fleet where it looked like anyone could have gotten a great start with clear air the point being that even in large competitive fleets like that if you have a proper starting approach maybe something that's a little different than what everybody else is doing you can still find a hole to start in with clear air so let's take a look at this diagram again from the book getting started in sailboat racing I'm using the second edition and learn how to do this whole Port Tac approach so you're going to start by reaching away on starboard Tac with about 3 minutes left to the start and then you're going to want to turn around and head back with let's say about a minute 50 to the start leave yourself plenty of time once you get back we're leaving ourselves almost double here because we've sailed away for 1 minute and we're sailing back for almost 2 minutes that extra minute is going to give us the maneuvering room that we need to sail down the starting line and look for our hole so again we're sailing back with about a minute 50 seconds let's say to the starts now is the time when you need to kind of be right on your toes you're going to be sailing back across the fleet on Port Tac which means you don't have rideway so you're going to be ducking people left and right so that's why I say this isn't really a start for somebody that's a faint of heart so you're Port tacking across the fleet and while you're just having this crazy moment of boats coming at you left and right and you're trying not to hit anybody you also need to be looking there at the starting line now if this isn't the kind of multitasking that you signed up for maybe you want to have somebody else um looking for the hole back at the starting line but at some point ideally you're going to see a gap between all those boats that are lining up to the start you don't want to tack right into it you want to sail all the way as far as you can to the wind W side of the hole and then tack now you're on starboard you made it and since you're on the upwind side of the hole you have room to foot off for Speed at the start one of the advantages to this start the port tack approach is that when you finish it you're on starboard Tack and you have lured position over the rest of the fleet so let's watch this guy do it it's really a great example I'm not sure if he planned this it looks like he got a little bit far behind here and then decided you know what I'm G to try something different so we're taking a look at boat 55 and you can see on the right hand side the time until start we have about 50 seconds left of course we can see it's less than a minute because we have our green Pacer line and green starting box is shrinking so he was sailing along um you know reaching in reaching out on this big long starting line and he's kind of stuck behind this line of boats you can see he's been footing down it looks like probably to pick up a little bit of speed um getting ready to tack and he sees this hole um between this line of boats here and the next pack that's coming so he's flopped over on to Port Tac and he is heading across the fleet for him this is a pretty easy decision there isn't anybody coming right at him any traffic that he's going to have to duck directly um except for these two boats down here but he has plenty of speed to not be in their way so you can see now he has done what we've talked about which is he's sailing to The Far Side as far as he can of that hole to give him the room to foot down right here and get speed to stay in front of these boats that he just tacked right in front of and really have a pretty decent start considering where he was within the fleet so here's the 3D angle which lets you see quite a bit more so here he is boat 55 now remember this track coming out behind him that's colorcoded for Speed so we can see basically the green is slower the yellow's going to be a little bit faster so here he is again footing down for that speed and tacking over if you look you can see the hole that he's seeing that's why he decided to make this tack across and now instead of just tacking right back onto starboard he's going to go a little bit further to give himself that room to take full advantage of the hole and get really clear air and here he is going to attack right in front of these other boats and they were kind of slowing down you know in that pack getting ready they didn't want to be too early for the start but he sailed in on that Port tack with clear air and really good speed and was able to maintain that and stay in front of them so that's a pretty thorough explanation of the port tack approach we'll see you next week if you

Transcript:
[Music] welcome to race to win a sailing podcast brought to you by race.com we review 3D rata replays and analyze racing tactics rules and winning strategies my name is jacen and today's podcast is is about upwind race geometry if you're an experienced racer please bear with me as I go over some of the basics the recording we're using today is from a j24 rata in Texas and let me go back a little bit and talk first about the wind a lot of race cu's users will ask us how does the program know where the wind is coming from and uh the algorithm that we use to compute the wind isir complex but the simple version is that it divides people's tacking angles in half so if somebody is sailing along at 315° and then they tack to 45° which is a 90° Tac we can guess that the wind is probably at about zero or True North what's more we have this data from all of the boats on the race course so we can average out that data to figure out where the wind is coming from and even tell where the shifts are you'll see here that I'm clicking on various TXS which appear as those white dots and it's showing different tacking angles so that one was 100° which is um a totally plausible tacking angle for a j24 and lighter air and let me switch boats here and you'll see that this person is uh got a tacking angle of 90° and their next tack was 72° so they hit a shift there and tacked on it well done and this one's 82 degrees so they hit another shift so by taking all those TXS we can really get a very clear picture of where exactly the wind was at any given time during the race okay so now that we know where the wind is let's talk about lay lines a little bit most of you probably know that uh the lay line is a hypothetical two hypothetical lines that come out of the mark that represent where you have to tack in order to fetch the mark without tacking again you can see that the race cu's interface displays two lay lines now in a second you're going to see the lay line uh get much wider right about there okay so let's talk about what can do that there are two possible explanations uh the first which I think we're seeing here is different winds on different sides of the the course can create uh lay lines that are at a greater than 90° angle the second possibility uh is that the wind became much lighter which changes the angle that the boats are sailing at relative to the wind and might make the lay lines quite a bit wider one important note that I think a lot of beginner Sailors fail to understand is that whatever course you take from the start line to the windward Mark is going to be the same distance uh if the holds steady if the wind is Shifting you can sail more Distance by sailing into the headers um or failing to head up on the lifts but if the wind is steady as long as you are within the lay lines and you have not overto stood or gone outside the lay lines you're going to sail the same amount of distance from the start line to the windward Mark next I want to show you the lad rung display or match mode in race cues um which shows how far how much progress you've made to Windward how far you are to Windward or what Ladder rung you are is how well you're doing in the race or on the Winward leg as long as you are still within the lay lines sometimes Sailors will come to us and say hey I fell behind this other boat like 200 meters in a matter of seconds that's not possible I wasn't moving that fast of course they're right they weren't moving that fast but it's entirely possible in a major wind shift and that's what we've been watching right here the wind has shifted really far left and frankly Scarlet has gained about 300 M on uh the red Boat Bling um in a very short period of time in fact it's gone so far left that frankly Scarlet has now overstood the lay line and sailed more than the minimum distance of course bling is totally screwed out on the right okay here's another example of uh the raceu match mode tool and the Ladder rung so you can see these boats are basically right on the same Ladder rung let me move it a little bit all right all right so which one's going to get to the mark first they're on the same Ladder rung that one taxs on the lay line they basically get to the Mark at the exact same time okay let's watch it again and I'll talk a little bit more about the Ladder rung remember the Ladder rung is always perpendicular to the wind so as long as you're within the lay lines the farther up the ladder you are the better you're doing this illustrates the danger of getting too far out on one side of the course too early in the windward leg when you do that it's called building leverage and just like when Banks build leverage it comes with a lot of risk so bling went way far out on the right side of the course and built a ton of Leverage on the fleet if the wind had gone right instead of left they would have been in first place but it went left instead of right and now they're in dead last the other risk of going way out to one side early in a Winward leg is that if a big shift comes you can end up overstood and thus sailing more than the minimum distance as frankly Scarlet does here all right that's it for today's podcast thank you for tuning in to the race to win podcast brought to you by race cues and make sure you visit our website race.com podcast or leave us a review on iTunes

Transcript:
[Music] welcome to race to win a saing podcast brought to you by race.com we analyze race cu's 3D rot replays and review racing tactics rules and winning strategies today we're going to go over the dingy start which is a pretty classic small boat starting strategy will work well for almost any boat that has relatively fast acceleration but if the boat that you are on is something that takes a day and an age to get going this is not going to be the start for you basically the way that you carry this out is you're going to find your spot on the line and just stop you're going to stop just right next to the starting line wait there until the gun is just about to go off and right before it goes off you're just going to pull in your sails accelerate and start boom sounds really easy um it is however also pretty easy to screw it up if you pull in your sales too soon you're going to shoot over the line over early and if you accelerate too late you'll be late to the start the thing is in these dingy starts everybody is often doing pretty much the same thing so you're going to get a big line of people all lined up on the starting line waiting for that right moment to pull in those their sales and go for the L line now that can be helpful if you're a beginner because you can just look at the guy next to you and when he sheets in you sheet in off you go so let's get into the details just like before I'm using a replay of the 2013 melgis World Championships in San Francisco Bay uh in case you missed the earlier explanations we're looking at the starting area and you can see this green line a green sh shrinking area that's the race Q starting line uh I call it the Pacer line and it's something that's calculated to give you the proper Pace to start on time if your boat is moving along just like this guy right on the Pacer line you're going to have an ontime start if you're behind it you're late and if you're in front of it you're early we also have the fleet rankings and the time to start here on the right hand side something that we haven't talked about yet in this series is finding the favored end of the starting line I like to think of the favored end as the part of the line that is closest or furthest upwind to the Winward Mark if you don't know how to find the favorite end of the line it's really easy just sail right up to where the the line is and turn into the wind until your Sails are ling just straight down the middle of the boat so you know that you're directly head to wind when you're head to wind if your bow is closer to the pin and the line that's the favorite end if your bow is closer to the bat end of the line that's the favorite end easy right so most of the time you would think it would be better to start at the favored end of the line but the question is how favored is it really do you really want to be battling it out for position right in the middle of the pack or is it better to start on the other side where Nobody's around maybe you don't have as good a position but you can get clear air and just get away from all those people that are battling it out on the favorite end so once you decide where on the line you want to start then you need to strategy for how to approach the line this is a pretty easy start to execute if you're a beginner just find your hole on the starting line which can be difficult in big fleets but find your hole sit there and then when the guy next to you pulls his sails in and a lot of times he is right next to you just inches away you pull your sales in at the same time and off you go in a crowded Fleet there is a problem with running out of room if you don't secure your position on the line early enough you're going to end up in the second row and once you're behind in a lot of these dingy type races it's very hard to get ahead most of the time in these competitive One Design fleets where you start is where you finish so if you start last you're probably going to be finishing pretty close to the end so the start is very important let's watch an example of a melis 24 executing kind of a modified version of the dingy start so keep an eye on both 37 you can see from that colored line which is his Speedco GPS track he's kind of been hanging out in this area now he stopped um there's a minute to the start and he's knows where he wants to go wow did you see that little acceleration there he was not going to let that boat get his spot and now he's early he is too early to the start so he's going to come right up to the edge of the starting line stop lay in wait for this boat behind him and just when he thinks he might sneak by accelerate up to full speed and he starts just right on time and off he goes so that is a great example of a dingy start it happened pretty fast uh let's watch it one more time here so this time we're going to watch it from head on um the boats are actually sailing away from us right now he's kind of playing around in the starting area here trying to pick out his hole remember the the place on the line where he's going to start so now we're 1 minute from the start and here he is stopped just completely stopped sees a gap in front of him that he's going to get ready to go for so whoosh there's that little Spurt of speed again that was a little too fast he's a little early so he's going to slow down let the sails out a bit and now here again is where he's going to come to a total dead stop the classic dingy start here comes that guy up behind him again he's not going to get by though he's got his timing down accelerates hard Woos right over the line looks like he was late by if you look up about 37 6 seconds so that's you know pretty good considering um the amount of boats there are in this Fleet but you can see with the fleet rankings on the right it's really interesting um to see who used which methods and and how their start was that's all I have for you today I hope that watching these series is helping you get down the basics of your starting techniques or review them if it's been a while and uh we look forward to talking about more advanced things coming up soon if you enjoyed this podcast

[Music] welcome to race to win a sailing podcast brought to you by race.com we analyze race cu's 3D rot replays and review racing tactics rules and winning strategies I'm Julia and today's podcast is the second one in a five part series about saleboat race starting strategies today we're going to talk about the Vanderbilt start which was named for famous America's Cup Skipper and super rich guy Harold Vanderbilt it's a pretty simple start similar in execution to the reachin ReachOut start we discussed in the last podcast but there are a few key differences before I delve into the finer points of the starting strategy I want to make sure that we're on the same page with this 3D animated replay here this is a replay of the 23 13 melgis World Championships held in San Francisco Bay the starting area is defined in this replay as this green shrinking box on one end you have the Pacer line which is this line here that the race cu's app actually calculates now on the other end you have the starting line basically if you're in front of the Pacer line you're going to be early to your start and if you're behind the Pacer line you're going to be late you want to be just right on it to get an ontime start this is a really great visual tool to help me evaluate who did a good job of judging time and distance to the start and who was a little bit off soon we're going to be coming out with a new version of the perfect start component of our iPhone app which makes this Pacer line actually show up on your phone screen as you're physically 2 minutes from the start and it's a really great tool to help you get to the starting line on time so anyways let's take a look at how to pull off the Vanderbuilt start otherwise known as the full speed approach so not unlike the reaching in Reaching Out start this is going to work better in a small friendly Fleet where you can make these big long runs out and in without too much interference from other boats and without getting dumped on by a lot of bad air it's pretty easy to execute you're going to start up by the starting line and then reach away for let's say a minute on a broad reach now the reaching in reaching out crowd will be heading out on a bean reach so this means that when you Jive around and head for the start you're going to be lured of all of those people and then as an added benefit you'll see them all off to wind as well so by taking this slightly different approach it's meant to kind of get you out of the pack a little bit so once you make your JB around and you're heading back towards the starting line you want to go be going as close to full speed as possible not completely full throttle because you want to have a little bit of maneuvering left in case you need to accelerate what if you're a little bit late to the start um if you're a little bit early you can just um turn down and sail down the starting line a little bit to get a little bit further down keeping your full speed before you turn and head for the line again so this idea with this approach is that you're able to maintain a lot of control because you're going at almost full speed the entire time so that means you're going to be able to punch through anybody that's trying to sit on top of you to Winward you'll be able to roll boats to lward left people up um speed is one of the things that is going to give you the control that you need to battle your way to a spot on the starting line so we're going to be using boat 8 for our example right now you can see he's kind of stopped going about a knot he's just completed that job we can see that colored Line running through the starting area that's his GPS track so he's already reached away from the starting line has made his Jive and is headed back now there's one minute to the start I can see that up here on the right hand side I can have a I have a timer that's ticking down and then I also can see who is the closest to the starting line so he's picking up speed now again we call this the full speed approach and you're going to see him maintain between five or six knots um he slowed a little bit down right now he's turning down the line that's because he's a little early and we can agree with that because he's ahead of that green Pacer line that we talked about so now he's come back up again and he is still a little bit early just ahead of the Pacer line you can see how he really is to lured of this whole group of people over there that were probably doing more of a reachin Reach Out approach as opposed to the vanderbel start where remember you go away on a broad reach so you end up below everybody so he is sailing a bit of a zigzag course which is a great way to slow down if you're a little bit early for the start but he is maintaining that full speed so he's going to start at just about six knots and off he goes out of the fleet of the 25 boats that we recorded he was sixth across the starting line so that's really pretty good now I say this isn't for crowded fleets but you know that there was about 60 boats in this rata although we only see about 25 here in the replay but these are professional level Racers so he was able to make this work in this Fleet and get a pretty good start that being said there's no magic bullet there's no perfect starting strategy that's going to work for you every time of course a Savvy Skipper is going to listen to these podcasts maybe have everything filed away and then adapt the techniques to change on the fly as necessary now that you know the basics of the Vanderbilt start and the reaching In-N-Out start you've got a couple things to try out if you're getting back into spring sailing and you might want to try out the free race cues app this weekend too and make your own 3D rata replay it's amazing to go back and watch yourself and see you know what you could have done differently uh the race cu's app is totally free so give it a try you can download it um for smartphones it works on both iPhones yet it in iTunes or most Androids so if you try out the app send us a clip of your replay on YouTube and we'd love to interview you and maybe even feature you in our next podcast see you next time if

welcome to race to win a sailing podcast brought to you by race cues calm we analyze race use 3d regatta replays and review racing tactics rules and winning strategies I'm Julia and today's podcast is the first in a series about starting strategies we're going to get started with a basic starting strategy which is reaching out and reaching in reaching out and reaching in is a classic starting strategy it's one of the first ones that you learn it really works best when neither the pin or the boat end of the line is favored basically when the committee has done a good job of putting a line Square to the wind it's not something that you want to use in a large start it's really better in smaller less aggressive fleets like your regular Sunday night club race this particular fleet is about 60 boats it's the 2013 Malchus national championships in San Francisco Bay so the example that we're going to show you of reaching out and reaching in is actually a little bit more of a creative use this start is very easy to execute and really forgiving you're just going to reach down the starting line for a sudden amount of time let's say one minute and you can see here in my example I have a arrow pointing at a colored line that is the color-coded GPS track of the boat we're using in this example it's color-coded for speed so you can see exactly how fast and slow he was going just with a glance so let's say you sail down the starting line for one minute you're going to turn around and head back for another minute that should put you right on the starting line at the start now it's really pretty forgiving because if you went a little bit too fast you can simply sail down the starting line for a bit before hardening up and beginning the race if you're a little bit too slow you should be able to pour on a little bit extra speed and get there in time so let's watch how one of the professional level racers does this at this Malchus championship regatta so we're looking at the bird's eye or 2d view and this is boat 29 here with the names change to protect the innocent or not so innocent the starting area is defined in this replay as this green shrinking box on one end you have the Pacer line which is this line here that the race cues app actually calculates now on the other end you have the starting line basically if you're in front of the pace align you're going to be early to your start and if you're behind the Pacer line you're going to be late you want to be just right on it to get an on-time start so let's see what our friendly little boat twenty-nine here has been up to you can see from his GPS track he reached down the starting line he's made his turn and he is coming back now he looks like he's going to be a little bit late he's biding his time he's found his hole and he is going to sneak just barely right inside the committee boat but he is going to have clean air and a great start let's look at this in 3d and get a little bit better angle so here we're looking at the boat head on and you can see his GPS track as he's been reaching down the starting line now remember there is no one start that's going to work in every fleet so this is a great example of taking a classic maneuver and changing it up a little bit to work in a busy fleet like this one we can see in the replay the time left until the start in the upper right hand corner and then we can also see the distance left to the line here for boat 29 that I've highlighted so keep an eye on those two things as we watch what happens so as we see the boats have made their turn and he's getting ready to approach the line and cross there's just about 30 seconds left or even less to the start you can see that pacer line is coming you can see the whole rest of the fleet there now this is a very competitive start the Malchus national championships has some of the top sailboat racers in the world right now now look at this he's just stopped parked waiting for his moment there now remember there are 60 boats but we only were able to record about 24 with race queues he was able to sit all the way at the end of the fleet and then get his moment to sneak just right inside the committee boat there for he's got clear air he's a little bit behind some of the boats but really it was a pretty great start now then you have this guy behind him who is having to tack away from the from the dirty air so just to review it's it's this is an easy technique you reach out for a minute reach back in for a minute and pretty much turn and start it doesn't require a really good sense of time and distance because like I mentioned it's very easy to adjust there's some problems one is the fact that because this is such a classic start everybody's trying to do this and so if you're in a boat a fleet with seven or eight boats and everyone's trying to do this you can really end up in a situation where you're sort of join the parade everybody's doing the same thing everybody's in bad air and you might have to do something like tack out and end up trying to port tack the fleet there is no one starting strategy that's going to work every time so tune in to our next podcast to learn about the next one on my list which is the Vanderbilt start or the full speed approach see you next time if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more on our website w wrff comm

[Music] welcome to race to win a sailing podcast brought to you by race q.com we review 3D Riata replays and analyze racing rules tactics and winning strategies my name is jacen and today we're going to talk a little bit more about lured Mark roundings and and uh how messy it can get at a lured gate in the replay I'm showing you right now from the 2013 melis 24 World Championships you can see it gets pretty crowded at the lur gate uh what the sailors see as the right gate Mark so we're going to review this situation starting with the two boats that came in first and analyze everyone's right away and see if anybody fouled other boats let me back up and we'll go through it a little bit slower okay so here we are at the beginning you can see boat 46 has jbed over to starboard and is now the starboard boat boat 43 must now also Jive to keep clear of 46 and you see they both round um with 46 behind 43 no issues there first rule 10 starboard overport applies and there thereafter once the overlap is established boat 43 has Mark room according to rule 18 it gets a lot more complicated with the pack of boats just behind 46 and 43 uh so let me back up again and we'll talk about everybody's rights as they come into this gate Mark okay so I'm going to advance frame by frame here we see 43 jib over and then they are overlapped boats on the same Tack and um 46 is obligated to give 43 Mark room no problem there but let's look a little bit further up all right there we go so you can see it's getting pretty busy um the boats are mostly coming in on the port Tac they're mostly going wide because they want to give their guys at the front of the boat uh a nice deep C of sailing to get that Spiner down but also so that they get a good wide and tight rounding and get an appropriate Lane to head back up wind some are overlapped some are not and what I'm going to do here is I'm going to uh switch the boats that we're looking at uh over to boat 26 and boat 38 okay so 38 is definitely on the outside of the boat in front of her right here and 26 is is clear a stern of 38 that means 38 is not obligated to give 26 Mark room all right let me go back a couple frames and we'll watch what happens frame by frame so as I Advance forward here you're going to see 38 in her effort to make a good wide and tight rounding is actually going to leave the three boo length zone right here okay unfortunately what this means for both 38 is that rule 18.2 B which entitled her to Mark room because she reached the Zone first ceases to apply now boat 26 is the first in the zone and is entitled to Mark room you see 38 J 26 also jbes to keep her um obligation under rule 10 and also she needs to round the mark now if you were watching closely there you saw 38 had to head down a little bit to avoid colliding with 26 I'm guessing she probably protested 26 either claiming that 26 did not have Mark room which is incorrect because 38 left the zone or as the lured boat uh however you can see 26's turn is consistent she's doing all she can to keep clear of starboard Tac 38 once 38 jibes so in fact she's in the clear so watching it again here we see 38 leave the Zone 26 stays in the zone 38 jobs 26 jobs now there is an overlap and 26 has Mark room remember 38 was almost a boat length ahead when they entered the zone now whether this was a boat handling mistake or just a good rule situation for 26 is undetermined but the point is it's really important to understand rule 18 at a deep level so that when you get to the chaos of the lur Mark or the lur gate you can be the one who knows your rights and can come out ahead of your competitors thanks for tuning in to this week's episode of Race To Win I hope you enjoyed it uh if you did please leave us a review on iTunes and don't forget to visit our website at race.com SLP podcast we'll see you next week and in the meantime get out sailing

[Music] welcome to race to win a sailing podcast brought to you by race.com we review 3D rata replays and analyze racing tactics rules and winning strategies I'm jaen and today's podcast is about that classic rule of Mark roundings which is to round wide and tight our rata today is the third race from the first day of racing at the 2013 melis 24 World Championships and you can see three is trailing 35 into the lured Mark three is sailing hotter than 35 meaning they're closer to the wind to go a little bit faster they're trying to get on 35's air and in doing so they're getting a little bit greedy and you're going to see here that 35 makes a nice wide and tight rounding so that they're all the way up to close Hal when they pass nearest to the mark three by contrast doesn't make a wide and tight rounding and they end up in a lower Lane than 35 it doesn't matter at first but pretty soon they're getting dirty air from 35 and they just can't hold the same angle to the wind and they start to fall back and lose ground to 35 you'll see here eventually they're going to have to tack out they just keep falling away the distance has now grown from two or three boat lengths to five or six boat lengths and finally three decides that's it I have to tack and by the time we get up to the Winward Mark there are at least 12 bolt lengths back now this is a pretty rare mistake to see at this high level so it was actually quite difficult for me to find an example of it from the M 24 World Championships let's take another look from above I'm going to come in at the point where three is just starting to cross 35's trail and sail hotter three was actually leading earlier in this leg and I imagine they're a little bit cranky that they've fallen behind so here they are they're sailing a little bit closer to the wind than 35 because they really want to get on 35's Breeze unfortunately that's just not going to be possible and you'll actually see right about you're actually going to see 35 duck down here to make sure they get a proper wide and tight mark rounding but three is going to stay hot meaning they're going to stay close to the wind there it is right there 35 Dives even deeper make it easier for the guys at the front of the boat to douse that Spiner and also to ensure they get a proper Mark rounding and there you see them pass close to the mark already on a closeall course three of course doesn't do that and right away they start falling off when the dirty Breeze from 35 they can't hold the same angle and as we know they're going to have to tack out so next time you head into a lured Mark rounding make sure you go wide and tight to protect your upwind lane download the free race cu's app and make your own 3D replays send us your clip and maybe you'll be featured on next week's podcast if you enjoyed this podcast you can find more at our website www.rac.com podcast or by searching race cues on iTunes we'd love to hear from you so give us a review on iTunes or send us your footage
